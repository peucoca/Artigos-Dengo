Identification of key threats to N. cinerea population recovery, including disease and pollutants, is an objective of the species' recovery plan. Previous studies have identified Uncinaria sanguinis, an intestinal nematode, as a significant cause of disease and mortality in N. cinerea pups. Given the impact of heavy metals on the immune response, investigation of these pollutants is critical. To this end, the concentrations of arsenic (As), total mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb) and selenium (Se) were determined in blood collected from N. cinerea pups sampled during the 2017/18, 2019 and 2020/21 breeding seasons at Seal Bay Conservation Park, South Australia. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in Hg, As, Cr, and Se concentrations and molar ratio of Se:Hg were seen between breeding seasons. Pup age, maternal parity and inter-individual foraging behaviour were considered factors driving these differences. The concentrations of Hg (357, 198 and 241 µg/L) and As (225, 834 and 608 µg/L) were high in 2017/18, 2019 and 2020/21 respectively with Hg concentrations in the blood of N. cinerea pups above toxicological thresholds reported for marine mammals. The concentration of Se (1332, 647, 763 µg/L) and molar ratio of Se:Hg (9.47, 7.98 and 6.82) were low compared to other pinniped pups, indicating potential vulnerability of pups to the toxic effects of Hg. Significant (p < 0.05) negative associations for Pb and Cd with several red blood cell parameters suggest they could be exacerbating the anaemia caused by hookworm disease. Temporal (age-related) changes in element concentrations were also seen, such that pup age needs to be considered when interpreting bioaccumulation patterns. Further investigation of the role of elevated heavy metal concentrations on N. cinerea pup health, disease and development is recommended, particularly with respect to immunological impacts.",20220923,169,,10.1016/j.envint.2022.107521,1873-6750

Forty-eight Latxa ewes were fed during the last five weeks of pregnancy with two experimental diets: a control diet based on a neutral concentrate and forage (tall fescue hay; CO-FES), and a supplemented diet based on polyunsaturated (PUFA)-rich concentrate and tanniferous forage (sainfoin; ALA-SAIN). After parturition, twenty ewes had their blood and colostrum sampled, and their lambs were monitored until post-weaning. Lambs were afterwards subjected to (i) an aversive handling period (AHP) followed by a behavioral assessment and (ii) inflammatory and lymphocyte proliferation challenge. Feeding ALA-SAIN resulted in changes in colostrum fatty acid composition, specifically higher &#945;-linoleic acid (p &lt; 0.001), conjugate linoleic acid (p = 0.005), vaccenic acid (p = 0.006) and long-chain n-3 PUFA (p = 0.004).

A clear understanding of the mechanisms of the host immune response generated upon viral infections is a prime requisite for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Hence, we present here a comparative study of alterations in immune response upon SARS-CoV-2 and Ebola virus infections that illustrate many common features. Vaccination and pregnancy are two important aspects that need to be studied from an immunological perspective. So, we summarize the outcomes and immune responses in vaccinated and pregnant individuals in the context of COVID-19 and EVD. Considering the significance of immunomodulatory approaches in combating both these diseases, we have also presented the state of the art of such therapeutics and prophylactics. Currently, several vaccines against these viruses have been approved or are under clinical trials in various parts of the world. Therefore, we also recapitulate the latest developments in these which would inspire researchers to look for possibilities of developing vaccines against many other RNA viruses.

There is little evidence about acute stress around the calving event and subsequent potential effects for the cows' immunological status or subsequent reproductive health. To investigate this, 55 crossbred recipient beef heifers carrying purebred Simmental embryos were assigned to one of three groups on day 285 of gestation: (i) control (no parturition induction treatment; nâ¯=â¯19); (ii) induction of parturition with corticosteroid (nâ¯=â¯20) and (iii) induction of parturition with corticosteroid plus prostaglandin (nâ¯=â¯16). Interval from induction of parturition to calving and calving ease was recorded. Reproductive tract examinations were conducted on Day 21 (D21) and Day 42, and a sample was obtained for the determination of uterine cytology on D21. Blood samples were taken from the dams two weeks before parturition, one day after parturition (D1) and two weeks after parturition (D14) for gene expression and cortisol and calcium concentration determination. Calves were weighed at birth and subsequently every week until they were 10â¯weeks of age. A colostrum sample was taken immediately after calving and stored for subsequent Immunoglobin G (IgG) concentration analysis. Data were analysed using ANOVA with posthoc Tukey, Spearman correlation and stepwise backwards linear regression using SAS. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed on the following immune genes: Interleukins IL1a and b, IL2, IL4, IL8, Tumour Necrosis Factor Alpha, Interferon-gamma, Lymphotoxin, Toll-Like Receptor, Nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells 1 and 2, glucocorticoid receptor alpha, as well as the neutrophil genes that regulate inflammation: Fas, L-selectin, MMP-9 and BPI. The results show that compared with non-induced contemporaries, induction has no negative effect on dystocia or subsequent calf weight gain but can have a positive effect on colostral IgG concentration. Blood calcium concentrations on both D1 and D14 postcalving are associated with subsequent uterine health. Parturition events were reflected in temporal changes in the expression of the cytokines IFNÎ³, TNF&#945;, IL1b, IL4, IL8 and Haptoglobin in the dams' blood, all of which are associated with the immune competence of the cow during this period. The conclusion is that induction of calving can have a positive effect on colostral IgG concentration. Calcium concentrations postcalving are associated with subsequent reproductive tract health. Events associated with the peri- and postpartum period are all reflected in temporal changes in immune function-related cytokines.",20220606,16,6,10.1016/j.animal.2022.100550,1751-732X

Interference in these primary regulatory mechanisms, either at adolescence or prenatal state led to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Fertility restoration with the help of injectable gonadotrophins/progesterone, ovulation-inducing drugs, immunomodulatory drugs (corticosteroids), and reproductive surgeries provides inadequate responses, which manifest its own side effects. The development of a potential diagnostic biomarker and an effectual treatment for adverse pregnancy outcomes is a prerequisite to maternal and child health. Parent cell originated bi-layered-intraluminal nano-vesicles (30-150 nm) also known as exosomes are detected in all types of bodily fluids like blood, saliva, breast milk, urine, etc. Exosomes being the most biological residual structures with the least cytotoxicity are loaded with cargo in the form of RNAs (miRNAs), proteins (cytokines), hormones (estrogen, progesterone, etc.), cDNAs, and metabolites making them chief molecules of cell-cell communication. Their keen involvement in the regulation of biological processes has portrayed them as the power shots of cues to understand the disease's pathophysiology and progression. Recent studies have demonstrated the role of immunexosomes (immunomodulating exosomes) in maintaining unwavering immune homeostasis between the mother and developing fetus for a healthy pregnancy. Moreover, the concentration and size of the exosomes are extensively studied in adverse pregnancies like preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and preterm premature rupture of membrane (pPROMs) as an early diagnostic marker, thus giving in-depth information about their pathophysiology. Exosomes have also been engineered physically as well as genetically to enhance their encapsulation efficiency and specificity in therapy for cancer and adverse pregnancies. Successful bench to bedside discoveries and interventions in cancer has motivated developmental biologists to investigate the role of immunexosomes and their active components. Our review summarizes the pre-clinical studies for the use of these power-shots as therapeutic agents. We envisage that these studies will pave the path for the use of immunexosomes in clinical settings for reproductive problems that arise due to immune perturbance in homeostasis either at adolescence or prenatal state.",20220506,13,,10.3389/fphar.2022.895254,1663-9812

Sufficient doses of tetanus toxoid containing vaccine during pregnancy ensure immunity against tetanus to mothers as well as newborns. Since inequalities persist across vaccination programs globally, in this paper, an attempt has been made to examine whether tetanus toxoid immunization (TTI) status among the women of reproductive age in Bangladesh for their most recent live birth born preceding 2 years of the survey changes with their living standard index (LSI). METHODS: Five domains of deprivation such as energy use, improved sanitation, drinking water, housing and assets ownership were used to compute the LSI using a approach proposed by Alkire and Foster. The adjusted association between LSI and TTI was established by using logistic regression model. For the purpose of statistical analysis, a nationally representative cross-sectional data extracted from Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (BMICS), 2019 have been used. RESULT: The bivariate analysis revealed that 79.5% (95% CI 78.0-81.0) of women with low and 83.1% (95% CI 81.3-84.9) with moderate living standards had sufficient vaccination coverage for their most recent pregnancies while this percentage was higher for the women who belonged to high living standard (85.2, 95% CI = 84.2-86.2). A strong evidence for greater odds of sufficient immunization with TT among the women maintaining a high standard of living (AOR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.08-1.42, p < 0.01) was found from regression analysis. CONCLUSION: The results depict existing living standard disparity with respect to TT vaccination coverage among women in Bangladesh. Present research suggests that immunization campaigns need to be conducted especially for the disadvantaged people to improve their health care and immunization service utilization among women within the age bracket of 15 to 49. This study proposed a scientific way to enhance TT vaccination among Bangladeshi women, which could help Bangladesh attain a widespread tetanus protection and thus, meet the SDGs for maternal and child mortality reduction.",20220524,22,1,10.1186/s12889-022-13448-7,1471-2458

However, as the positive predictive value (PPV) of a screening test decreases, the risk of a false-positive result increases. Objective: To evaluate whether HPV vaccination is associated with decreased PPV for abnormal cervical cytology. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study conducted via electronic medical record review included eligible patients aged 21 to 35 years who had at least 1 cervical cytology result within a single health system between January 2015 and December 2018. The health system comprises a partnership between an academic health center and a private not-for-profit health center. Patients with abnormal screening cytology and no diagnostic test results were omitted from analysis. Data were analyzed from December 2019 to November 2021. Exposures: HPV vaccination, defined as receiving at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine. Subgroup analyses were performed for those completing all vaccination doses per Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidelines and by age at vaccination initiation, dichotomized as younger than 21 years vs 21 years or older. Main Outcomes and Measures: PPV of abnormal cervical cytology for risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 or more severe diagnosis. Results: A total of 46â¯988 patients (mean [SD] age, 28.7 [4.5] years; 3058 [6.5%] Asian; 4159 [8.9%] Black or African American; 35â¯446 [75.4%] White) were included; 15â¯494 (33.0%) were at least partially vaccinated, and 4289 (9.1%) had abnormal cytology results during the study period. Among the individuals with abnormal cytology, the PPV for CIN 2 or more severe diagnosis was lower among vaccinated individuals (17.4%; 95% CI, 16.4%-18.4%) than unvaccinated individuals (21.3%; 95% CI, 20.4%-22.3%). Among vaccinated individuals, PPV was significantly lower among those completing vaccination (15.9%; 95% CI, 14.9%-17.0%) than those with incomplete vaccination (22.4%; 95% CI, 20.0%-25.0%), especially among those initiating vaccination when younger than 21 years (11.9%; 95% CI, 10.9%-12.9%) vs those initiating at age 21 years or older (30.7%; 95% CI, 27.3%-34.4%). Conclusions and Relevance: Among a population with relatively low HPV vaccine coverage, the PPV of cervical cytology for CIN 2 or more severe diagnosis was significantly lower among vaccinated individuals. PPV will likely further decrease in the future as a population with higher HPV vaccination coverage ages into screening. Confirmation of these results will call for changes in screening strategies, particularly for completely vaccinated individuals who initiated vaccination when younger than 21 years.",20220525,5,5,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.14020,2574-3805

Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic brought new challenges and opportunities to breastfeeding practices. Infection control measures in public hospitals included the cancellation of antenatal classes, hospital tours, and postnatal classes; suspension of perinatal visiting periods; and compulsory separation of COVID-19 positive mothers from newborns. In addition, work-from-home policies were widely implemented. This study aimed to identify the associated factors of six-month predominant breastfeeding (PBF), and to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on breastfeeding practice. METHODS: This study was conducted from 1 March 2021 to 7 April 2021 using a mixed-methods approach. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to members of breastfeeding or parenting groups who have had breastfeeding experience in the past 10 yrs. Logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with six-month PBF both in general and during the pandemic period. A qualitative content analysis was conducted using an inductive approach. RESULTS: The study included 793 participants. Giving birth in a public hospital (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.46, 3.34) and breastfeeding support from family and friends (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.05, 1.57) were significantly associated with six-month PBF, even during COVID-19. Factors associated with the self-rated impact of COVID-19 on breastfeeding include working from home, the perceived immunological benefits of breastfeeding, and the wish to avoid breastfeeding or expressing breast milk in public premises. Furthermore, breastfeeding practice in public hospitals was more likely to be affected by the busyness of staff, while private hospitals had worse rooming-in practices and staff who had inadequate breastfeeding knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Giving birth in a public hospital and having breastfeeding support from family and friends were associated with six-month PBF. Furthermore, COVID-19 in Hong Kong had an overall positive impact on six-month PBF. Further studies should investigate the impact of hospital practices and the COVID-19 pandemic on breastfeeding behaviours.",20220521,17,1,10.1186/s13006-022-00484-7,1746-4358

It has led to the concept that the ""first 1000 days"" from conception to the second birthday are critical in establishing long term health or susceptibility to disease. Immune ontogeny is predominantly complete within that time and is influenced by the maternal genome, health, diet and environment pre-conception and during pregnancy and lactation. Components of the immunological protection of the pregnancy is the generation of Th-2 and T-regulatory cytokines with the consequence that neonatal adaptive responses are also biased towards Th-2 (allergy promoting) and T-regulatory (tolerance promoting) responses. Normally after birth Th-1 activity increases while Th-2 down-regulates and the evolving normal human microbiome likely plays a key role. This in turn will have been affected by maternal health, diet, exposure to antibiotics, mode of delivery, and breast or cow milk formula feeding. Complex gene/environment interactions affect outcomes. Many individual nutrients affect immune mechanisms and variations in levels have been associated with susceptibility to allergic disease. However, intervention trials employing single nutrient supplementation to prevent allergic disease have not achieved the expected outcomes suggested by observational studies. Investigation of overall dietary practices including fresh fruit and vegetables, fish, olive oil, lower meat intake and home cooked foods as seen in the Mediterranean and other healthy diets have been associated with reduced prevalence of allergic disease. This suggests that the ""soup"" of overall nutrition is more important than individual nutrients and requires further investigation both during pregnancy and after the infant has been weaned. Amongst all the potential factors affecting allergy outcomes, modification of maternal and infant nutrition and the microbiome are easier to employ than changing other aspects of the environment but require large controlled trials before recommending changes to current practice.",20220423,14,8,10.3390/nu14081590,2072-6643

Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE) and its associated Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) in humans is associated with earlier initiation of alcohol use and increased rates of Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD). Initiation of alcohol use and misuse in early adolescence correlates highly with later AUD diagnosis as well. Thus, PAE and adolescent binge drinking set the stage for long-term health consequences due to adverse effects of alcohol on subsequent immune function, effects that may persist across the lifespan. The overarching goal of this review, therefore, is to determine the extent to which early developmental exposure to alcohol produces long-lasting, and potentially life-long, changes in immunological function. Alcohol affects the whole body, yet most studies are narrowly focused on individual features of immune function, largely ignoring the systems-level interactions required for effective host defense. We therefore emphasize the crucial role of the Central Nervous System (CNS) in orchestrating host defense processes. We argue that alcohol-mediated disruption of host immunity can occur through both (a) direct action of ethanol on neuroimmune processes, that subsequently disrupt peripheral immune function (top down); and (b) indirect action of ethanol on peripheral immune organs/cells, which in turn elicit consequent changes in CNS neuroimmune function (bottom up). Recognizing that alcohol consumption across the entire body, we argue in favor of integrative, whole-organism approaches toward understanding alcohol effects on immune function, and highlight the need for more work specifically examining long-lasting effects of early developmental exposure to alcohol (prenatal and adolescent periods) on host immunity.",20220421,216,,10.1016/j.pbb.2022.173390,1873-5177

DESIGN: Qualitative realist evaluation over two time points. SETTING: Government health facilities in Moroto District, Karamoja, Uganda. PARTICIPANTS: 69 participants involved in the delivery and uptake of integrated FP and childhood immunisation services. INTERVENTION: Integrated delivery of FP and childhood immunisation services offered to women accessing immunisation services in health facilities between January 2016 and December 2019. RESULTS: Four key themes were identified that encompassed context and mechanisms influencing acceptability of MCMs across both time points of the evaluation. These were: (1) fear of side effects of MCMs; (2) preference for natural FP methods; (3) pastoral lifestyles in the community and (4) food insecurity. The context of these themes changed over time leading to the triggering of mechanisms with an overall increase in acceptability of MCMs over time. Key mechanisms of acceptability triggered included: affective attitude, intervention coherence, self-efficacy, perceived effectiveness and opportunity cost, leading to the development of three context-acceptability theories. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, social and cultural norms played a strong role in influencing acceptability of the intervention. The context combined with intervention components were found to trigger several mechanisms that mapped to constructs of diffusion of innovations and acted as catalysts for mechanisms of acceptability. The context in which the intervention was implemented changed leading to the triggering of mechanisms and an increase in the perceived value and acceptability of MCM use.",20220409,12,4,10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054277,2044-6055

DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: Data were analysed from all healthcare facilities reporting to Kenya's health information system from January 2018 to March 2021. Multiple imputation was used to address missing data, interrupted time series analysis was used to quantify the changes in utilisation of services and sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess robustness of estimates. EXPOSURE OF INTEREST: COVID-19 outbreak and associated interventions. OUTCOME MEASURES: Monthly attendance to health facilities. We assessed changes in immunisation and various outpatient services nationally. RESULTS: Before the first case of COVID-19 and pursuant intervention measures in March 2020, uptake of health services was consistent with historical levels. There was significant drops in attendance (level changes) in April 2020 for overall outpatient visits for under-fives (rate ratio, RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.57), under-fives with pneumonia (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.47), overall over-five visits (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.75), over-fives with pneumonia (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.70), fourth antenatal care visit (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.93), total hypertension (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96), diabetes cases (RR 0.95 95% CI, 0.93 to 0.97) and HIV testing (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.99). Immunisation services, first antenatal care visits, new cases of hypertension and diabetes were not affected. The post-COVID-19 trend was increasing, with more recent data suggesting reversal of effects and health services reverting to expected levels as of March 2021.

An inverse correlation was seen between maternal vitD status and infant plasma TNF concentration (r = -0.27; p &lt; 0.05). Infant whole blood was also subjected to in vitro antigenic stimulation. TNF, IFNÎ³, IL-4, IL-13, and TGFß1 responses by infant leukocytes were significantly higher if mothers were vitD sufficient but were not as closely correlated to infants' own vitD status. Conversely, IL-10 and IL-12 responses after antigenic challenge were more correlated to infant vitD status. These data are consistent with vitD-mediated changes in breast milk composition providing immunological signaling to breastfeeding infants and indicate differential physiological effects of direct-infant versus maternal vitD supplementation.

Immunological changes originating during reproduction may help explain some of these relationships. METHODOLOGY: To explore the potential role of the immune system in female CoR, we characterized leukocyte composition and regulatory processes using DNA methylation (DNAm) in a cross-sectional cohort of young (20-22 years old) women differing in reproductive status. RESULTS: Compared to nulliparity, pregnancy was characterized by differential methylation at 828 sites, 96% of which were hypomethylated and enriched for genes associated with T-cell activation, innate immunity, pre-eclampsia and neoplasia. Breastfeeding was associated with differential methylation at 1107 sites (71% hypermethylated), enriched for genes involved in metabolism, immune self-recognition and neurogenesis. There were no significant differences in DNAm between nulliparous and parous women. However, compared to nullipara, pregnant women had lower proportions of B, CD4T, CD8T and natural killer (NK) cells, and higher proportions of granulocytes and monocytes. Monocyte counts were lower and NK counts higher among breastfeeding women, and remained so among parous women. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings point to widespread differences in DNAm during pregnancy and lactation. These effects appear largely transient, but may accumulate with gravidity become detectable as women age. Nulliparous and parous women differed in leukocyte composition, consistent with more persistent effects of reproduction on cell type. These findings support transient (leukocyte DNAm) and persistent (cell composition) changes associated with reproduction in women, illuminating potential pathways contributing to CoR. Lay Summary: Evolutionary theory and epidemiology support costs of reproduction (CoR) to women's health that may involve changes in immune function. We report differences in immune cell composition and gene regulation during pregnancy and breastfeeding. While many of these differences appear transient, immune cell composition may remain, suggesting mechanisms for female CoR.",20220216,10,1,10.1093/emph/eoac003,2050-6201

Oxidative stress and its related metabolic syndromes are potential risk factors in the susceptibility to, and severity of COVID-19. In concert with the earliest reports of COVID-19, obstetricians started to diagnose and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections during pregnancy (""COVID-19-Pregnancy""). High metabolic demand to sustain normal fetal development increases the burden of oxidative stress in pregnancy. Intracellular redox changes intertwined with acute phase responses at the maternal-fetal interface could amplify during pregnancy. Interestingly, mother-to-fetus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in most of the COVID-19-Pregnancy cases. This relative absence of vertical transmission may be related to the presence of lactoferrin in the placenta, amniotic fluid, and lacteal secretions. However, the cytokine-storm induced during COVID-19-Pregnancy may cause severe inflammatory damage to the fetus, and if uncontrolled, may later result in autism spectrum-like disorders and brain development abnormalities in neonates. Considering this serious health threat to child growth and development, the prevention of COVID-19 during pregnancy should be considered a high priority.

Pregnant women naturally have a reduced immune system due to immunological changes and decreased lung capacity due to respiratory adaptations, making them more susceptible to coronavirus complications. Within the Mount Sinai Health system, more than 15,000 deliveries are performed annually. We began to care for pregnant women with known COVID-19 infections in late March of 2020. In early April 2020, a policy was implemented to perform universal COVID-19 testing for all women planning to deliver within the Mount Sinai Health system. We examined the antibody response of postpartum women who delivered at Mount Sinai Hospital with a SARS-CoV-2 infection between the study intervals during March 15, 2020, through April 30, 2020. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective observational study examining the immune response of pregnant women who delivered at Mount Sinai Hospital with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Women with a SARS-CoV-2 infection were contacted via phone to discuss participation in the study. Patients who consented were scheduled for a phlebotomy visit to assess their antibody titer levels to COVID-19. The COVID-19 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) immunoglobulin (Ig)-G antibody test was used to evaluate the patients' antibody titers. The assay detects IgG antibodies for the detection of IgG seroconversion in patients following a known recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were identified with a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection who delivered within the prespecified time frame. Of those patients, 25 women agreed to participate and were included. Of them, 64.00% were Caucasian with a mean age of 35 years. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 30 kg/m2 and the majority of patients had commercial insurance (88.00%). The majority of women were asymptomatic for COVID-19 at the time of admission (80.00%) and the average gestational age of delivery and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 39 weeks' gestation. The later the gestational age at the time of diagnosis, the lower the antibody titer response. When examining the interval from diagnosis to antibody titer analysis, patients with the highest titers (2,880) tended to have a shorter interval between their COVID-19 diagnosis and the time at which the titer level was drawn. Patients with symptoms on admission had similar antibody titer levels when compared with women who were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: The antibody response among women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy appears to be greater when the patients are diagnosed at an earlier gestational age. KEY POINTS: · COVID-19 antibody status appears to be greater when diagnosed at an earlier gestational age.. · Asymptomatic and symptomatic pregnant women had similar antibody responses.. · Patients with the highest titers tended to have a shorter interval between their COVID-19 diagnoses..",20211112,39,7,10.1055/s-0041-1739469,1098-8785

Histopathological studies of P. falciparum-infected placentas revealed various placental abnormalities such as excessive perivillous fibrinoid deposits, breakdown of syncytiotrophoblast integrity, trophoblast basal lamina thickening, increased syncytial knotting, and accumulation of mononuclear immune cells within intervillous spaces. These events in turn, are likely to impair placental development and function, ultimately causing placental insufficiency, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery and low birth weight. Hence, a better understanding of the mechanisms behind placental alterations and damage during placental malaria is needed for the design of effective interventions.

Although an increased risk of immune-related diseases has been reported in children born after ART, there are no studies on the immunological status of these children. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of different embryo transfer methods and fertilization strategies on the immune status of the offspring. METHODS: A total of 69 children born to women treated with ART and a matched control group of 17 naturally conceived (NC) children, all aged from 3 to 6 years, were recruited in the reproductive hospital affiliated to Shandong University. The frequency of immune cells in the peripheral blood was assayed using flow cytometry; plasma cytokine levels were determined by multiplex cytokine immunoassay with human cytokine magnetic beads. RESULTS: Compared to children born after natural conception, children born after ART had elevated interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³) levels, regardless of embryo transfer and fertilization strategies. Children in the fresh-embryo transfer group had significantly higher IL-4 levels and a lower ratio of IFN-Î³ to IL-4 than those in the NC group ((P = 0.004, 10.41 ± 5.76 pg/mL vs 18.40 ± 7.01 pg/mL, P = 0.023, 1.00 ± 0.48 vs 0.67 ± 0.32, respectively).

PIMS main hypotheses are that ART initiation in pregnancy and ART-induced hypertension are associated with PTD and SGA respectively and that reconstitution of cellular immune responses in women on ART from before pregnancy results in increases in PTD of GA infants. PARTICIPANTS: Pregnant women (n=3972) aged &#8805;18 years regardless of HIV status recruited from 2015 to 2016 into the overall PIMS cohort (2517 HIV-negative, 1455 living with HIV). A nested cohort contained 551 women living with HIV who were &#8804;24 weeks' GA on ultrasound: 261 initiated ART before pregnancy, 290 initiated during the pregnancy. FINDINGS TO DATE: Women in the overall cohort were followed antenatally through to delivery using routine clinical records; further women in the nested cohort were actively followed up until 12 months post partum, with data collected on maternal health (HIV care and ART use, clinical care and intercurrent clinical history). Other procedures conducted on the nested cohort included physical examinations (anthropometry, blood pressure measurement), assessment of fetal growth (ultrasound), maternal and infant phlebotomy for storage of plasma, RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, collection of delivery specimens (placenta and cord blood) and infant 12-month developmental assessment. Preliminary findings have contributed to our understanding of risk factors for adverse birth outcomes, and the relationship between pregnancy immunology, HIV/ART and adverse birth outcomes. FUTURE PLANS: Using specimens collected from study participants living with HIV throughout pregnancy and first year of life, the PIMS provides a valuable platform for answering a variety of research questions focused on temporal changes of immunology markers in women whose immune status is altered by HIV infection, and how ART initiated during the pregnancy affects immune responses. The relationship between these immunological changes with adverse birth outcomes as well as possible longer-term impact of exposure to ART in fetal and early life will be explored. Additionally, further active and passive follow-up of mothers and their infants is planned at school-going age and beyond to chart growth, morbidity and development, as well as changes in family circumstances.",20211001,11,9,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047133,2044-6055

As pregnancy is characterized by significant changes in cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, and immunological systems, there are concerns on issues like the course of disease in pregnant women, safety of medications, route of delivery and risk of obstetric complications. The aim of this review is to summarize the current literature in the management of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although more than 90% of pregnant women with COVID-19 recover without serious morbidity, rapid deterioration of disease and higher rates of obstetric complications may be observed. The risk of vertical transmission has not been clearly revealed yet. Decreasing the number of prenatal visits, shortening the time allocated for the examinations, active use of telemedicine services, limiting the number of persons in healthcare settings, combining prenatal tests in the same visit, restricting visitors during the visits, providing a safe environment in healthcare facilities, strict hygiene control, and providing personal protective equipment during the visits are the main strategies to control the spread of disease according to current guidelines. Although new medication alternatives are being proposed every day for the treatment of COVID-19, our knowledge about the use of most of these drugs in pregnancy is limited. Preliminary results are promising for the administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the pregnant population. Timing of delivery should be decided based on maternal health condition, accompanying obstetric complications and gestational age. Cesarean delivery should be performed for obstetric indications.

In diagnostic imaging, the afflicted population showed pathognomonic findings of pneumonia. What started out as an epidemic in China, rapidly spread across geographical locations with a significant daily increase in the number of affected cases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, the range of worldwide mortality is 3 to 4%. Maternal adaptations and immunological changes predispose pregnant women to a prolonged and severe form of pneumonia, which results in higher rates of maternal, fetal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. There is limited data about the consequences of COVID-19 in pregnancy, thereby limiting the prevention, counseling, and management of these patients. The objective of this literature review is to explore pregnancy and perinatal outcomes of COVID-19, complications, morbidity, and mortality in this sub-population. We conducted a literature review pertaining to COVID-19 and pregnancy in databases such as: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct. The studies we chose to focus on were systematic reviews, meta-analysis, case series, and case reports. Twenty four articles were reviewed regarding COVID-19 and pregnancy, complications and their outcomes. Due to immunological changes during pregnancy as evidenced by the flaring of auto-immune diseases; pregnant women may be at an increased risk for infection. Women (19.7%) who had underlying comorbidities such as gestational DM, HTN, hypothyroidism, and autoimmune disease, COPD, or HBV infection were considered high risk. The most common maternal outcomes were premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and pre-eclampsia. Asthma was the most common comorbidity associated with maternal mortality. The most common neonatal complications were fetal distress leading to NICU admissions and preterm birth <37 weeks. The most common laboratory changes were elevated CRP and lymphocytopenia. Most patients underwent C-section due to their underlying comorbidities. Pregnant and lactating women did not shed viral particles through their vaginal mucus and milk, as evidenced by negative nucleic-acid tests of these secretions. Neonatal infections as demonstrated by positive RT-PCR were rare, but direct evidence supporting intrauterine transmission was not confirmed. Direct evidence indicating vertical transmission of COVID-19 is not available, but risk for transmission cannot be ruled out. Pregnant women should be closely monitored due to increased risk of adverse outcomes.",20210831,,,,

We aim to further understand repeat sexual violence victimization to develop responsive and appropriate treatment for survivors of sexual violence. METHODS: We present the immunological and contextual findings of a participant (N = 1) who experienced repeat sexual violence victimization during her enrollment in The THRIVE Study, a prospective case-control study of women aged 14-45 years, who have experienced recent consensual vaginal penetration (""controls"") or forced vaginal penetration (""cases""). Participants complete a survey, HIV/sexually transmitted infection, and pregnancy testing, blood sampling for C-reactive protein and adrenocorticotrophic hormone, collection of cervicovaginal fluid for immunological biomarkers, and self-collection of saliva samples for cortisol measurements, across study visits (Baseline, 1, and 3 months). RESULTS: The case study participant, aged 18 years upon enrollment, experienced sexual trauma before four of five study visits. Trends in the mental health indicators demonstrate reciprocal fluctuations in adverse mental health and resilience in accordance with revictimization and circumstantial changes. Suppressed immune biomarkers appear to correlate with increased adverse mental health, while mental health recovery trends with immunological recovery.

Maternal exposure to PM during pregnancy is particularly harmful to children's health since this is a phase of rapid human growth and development. METHOD: In this review, we synthesize the scientific evidence on adverse health outcomes in children following prenatal exposure to the smallest toxic components, fine (PM2.5) and ultrafine (PM0.1) PM. We highlight the established and emerging findings from epidemiologic studies and experimental models. RESULTS: Maternal exposure to fine and ultrafine PM directly and indirectly yields numerous adverse birth outcomes and impacts on children's respiratory systems, immune status, brain development, and cardiometabolic health. The biological mechanisms underlying adverse effects include direct placental translocation of ultrafine particles, placental and systemic maternal oxidative stress and inflammation elicited by both fine and ultrafine PM, epigenetic changes, and potential endocrine effects that influence long-term health. CONCLUSION: Policies to reduce maternal exposure and health consequences in children should be a high priority. PM2.5 levels are regulated, yet it is recognized that minority and low socioeconomic status groups experience disproportionate exposures. Moreover, PM0.1 levels are not routinely measured or currently regulated.

It has been postulated that these modifications are temporary and limited to the time of pregnancy. Growing evidence suggests that pregnancy has a long-term impact on maternal health, especially among women with pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia (PE). In addition, the presence of multiple immunological-associated changes in women that remain long after delivery has been reported. To explain these long-term modifications, we hypothesized that pregnancy induces long-term immunological memory with effects on maternal well-being. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the immunological phenotype of circulating immune cells in women at least 1 year after a normal pregnancy and after pregnancy complicated by PE. Using multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), we demonstrate that pregnancy has a long-term effect on the maternal immune cell populations and that this effect differs between normal pregnancy and pregnancy complicated by PE; furthermore, these modifications are due to changes in the maternal methylation status of genes that are associated with T cell and NK cell differentiation and function. We propose the existence of an ""immunological memory of pregnancy (IMOP)"" as an evolutionary advantage for the success of future pregnancies and the proper adaptation to the microchimeric status established during pregnancy.

Seventy-two Brangus heifers (36 heifers/yr) were stratified by body weight and body condition score and assigned to bahiagrass pastures (3 heifers/pasture/yr). Treatments were randomly assigned to pastures and consisted of (i) no pre- or postpartum supplementation (NOSUP), (ii) pre- and postpartum supplementation of protein and energy using 7.2 kg of dry matter/heifer/wk of molasses + urea (MOL), or (iii) MOL fortified with 105 g/heifer/wk of methionine hydroxy analog (MOLMET).

Thus, maternal weight can act, through mechanisms not fully understood, on the physiology and metabolism of some fetal organs and tissues, to adapt themselves to the intrauterine environment and nutritional reserves. These effects can occur by modulating gene expression, neonatal microbiome, and through breastfeeding. AREAS COVERED: In this paper, we investigated the potential effects of metabolites found altered in breast milk (BM) of overweight/obese mothers, through an extensive review of metabolomics studies, and the potential short and long-term clinical effects in the offspring, especially overweight, glucose homeostasis, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, infections, immune processes, neurodevelopment. EXPERT OPINION: Metabolomics seems the ideal tool to investigate BM variation depending on maternal or fetal/neonatal factors. In particular, BM metabolome alterations according to maternal conditions were recently pointed out in cases of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and maternal overweight/obesity. In our opinion, even if BM is the food of choice in neonatal nutrition, the deepest comprehension of its composition in overweight/obese mothers could allow targeted supplementation, to improve offspring health and metabolic homeostasis.",20210610,18,7,10.1080/14789450.2021.1940143,1744-8387

While the regulation of innate and adaptive immune protection in the FRT by hormonal cyclic changes across the menstrual cycle and pregnancy are being intensely studied, little to nothing is known about the alterations in mucosal immune protection that occur throughout the FRT as women age following menopause. The immune system in the FRT has two key functions: defense against pathogens and reproduction. After menopause, natural reproductive function ends, and therefore, two overlapping processes contribute to alterations in immune protection in aging women: menopause and immunosenescence. The goal of this review is to summarize the multiple immune changes that occur in the FRT with aging, including the impact on the function of epithelial cells, immune cells, and stromal fibroblasts. These studies indicate that major aspects of innate and adaptive immunity in the FRT are compromised in a site-specific manner in the FRT as women age. Further, at some FRT sites, immunological compensation occurs. Overall, alterations in mucosal immune protection contribute to the increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI), urogenital infections, and gynecological cancers. Further studies are essential to provide a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to restore immune protection and reverse conditions that threaten women's lives as they age.",20210505,20,5,10.1111/acel.13361,1474-9726

Studying age-related impacts on viral infection and vaccination outcomes requires an animal model that reflects both the physiological and immunological changes that occur with human aging, and sensitivity to differentially virulent influenza viruses. The ferret is uniquely susceptible to a plethora of influenza viruses impacting humans and has proven extremely useful in studying the clinical and immunological pictures of influenza virus infection. Moreover, ferrets developmentally have several of the age-related physiological changes that occur in humans throughout infancy, adulthood, old age, and pregnancy. In this review, we discuss ferret susceptibility to influenza viruses, summarize previous influenza studies using ferrets as models of age, and finally, highlight the application of ferret age models in the pursuit of prophylactic and therapeutic agents to address age-related influenza disease severity.",20210430,13,4,10.3390/v13040678,1999-4915

The Tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine was recommended in the Mexican Immunisation Programme for pregnant women in 2013. We describe pertussis morbidity and mortality trends in infants &#8804;2 and &#8804;12 months of age), before and after maternal Tdap immunisation implementation in Mexico. METHODS: An ecological retrospective database study was performed in the Mexican National and Workers Social Security Institutes (IMSS; ISSSTE). Data were collected on confirmed pertussis ambulatory cases, hospitalisations, and deaths, plus vaccination coverage (Tdap; Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis [DTPa]) and population estimates. Descriptive and regression time-trend analyses were performed for pertussis morbidity and mortality in infants between pre- (2010-2012) and post- (2014-2018) maternal Tdap immunisation periods. RESULTS: Around 1 million infants a year are covered in IMSS/ISSSTE databases. Average full primary infant DTPa vaccine coverage was 71.4%-72.7% nationally. Since 2013, annual maternal Tdap vaccine coverage ranged from 70%-93%. Between 2010-2018, 2,024 pertussis cases, 2,518 hospitalisations and 71 deaths were reported in infants. Among infants 0-2 months old (maternal immunisation target group), there was a significant decrease, post-maternal vaccination, in pertussis incidence (49.9%, p < 0.000), hospitalisation (70.0%, p < 0.000) and mortality (82.4%, p = 0.003). In infants 0-12 months old, pertussis hospitalisations (28.9%, p = 0.000) and mortality (36.2%, p = 0.059) decreased, but incidence increased (61.8%, p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: After maternal immunisation was implemented, there was a decreasing trend in incidence, hospitalisation and death due to pertussis in infants 0-2 months old. Increases in incidence reported in 0-12-month-olds are likely due to major changes in diagnosis and reporting introduced during the study period as well as limited vaccination and health coverage in some states. These findings confirm the important contribution of the Tdap maternal immunisation programme in reducing pertussis disease burden, particularly severe disease, among infants in Mexico.",20210328,39,16,10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.02.038,1873-2518

The objective of the current study was to investigate the shedding characteristics of various mastitis-causing pathogens and associated animal-specific (somatic cell score and parity) and environmental (heat stress) factors. In a longitudinal study, infected udder quarters were sampled consecutively on 5 dairy farms in Germany. To capture climatic factors, temperature-humidity index (THI) was calculated. In the laboratory analysis, the pathogens and their counts in the milk samples were determined. A generalized linear mixed model with gamma link was used to evaluate the factors influencing pathogen-shedding characteristics. The variables somatic cell count, pathogen, parity, and THI had significant influence on pathogen shedding. Staphylococci were shed in lower values than streptococci. The pathogen shedding from mammary gland quarters with intramammary infections was higher in the first and second lactation than in higher lactations. Exceeding the THI threshold 60 resulted in higher pathogen counts on the same day. This was only caused by the pathogens yeasts and Streptococcus uberis. Possible mechanisms causing differences in pathogen shedding are changes in the counts due to influenced milk quantities, better growth conditions at higher temperatures, or altered immunological reactions. The mechanisms often remain speculative and require further investigation. The study underlines the contribution of cows with high somatic cell counts regarding the transmission of mastitis pathogens within a herd. Furthermore, it becomes clear that heat stress in Germany influences udder health and that prevention measures are useful.",20201115,104,1,10.3168/jds.2020-19091,1525-3198

This study aimed to describe clinical and immunovirological status after transition in patients with perinatal HIV. METHODS: Patients participating in the Spanish multicenter pediatric HIV cohort (CoRISpe) transferred to adult care (FARO cohort) from 1997 to 2016 were included. Clinical and immunovirological data were collected from 12 years old to the last follow-up moment after transition (up to December 2017). We used mixed-effect models to analyze changes in CD4 counts or viral suppression and multivariate analysis for risk factors for virological failure (VF) and immune status after transition. Transition years were classified into 5-year periods. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-two youths were included. The median age at transition was 18 years (interquartile range: 16.3-18.9) and 58.1% women. The median follow-up time after transition was 6.6 years (interquartile range: 4.6-9.8), and 11 patients (3.3%) died. The immunovirological status at transition improved over the last periods. Globally, VF decreased from 27.7% at transition to 14.4% at 3 years post-transition (P < 0.001), but no changes were observed in the last 2 transition periods. There were no significant differences in CD4 over the transition period. Risk factors for VF after transition were female sex, being born abroad and VF at transition, and for lower CD4 after transition were Romani heritage, younger age at transition, lower CD4 nadir, and CD4 at transition. CONCLUSIONS: After transition, virological suppression improved in the early transition periods, and immunological status remained stable. Nevertheless, some patients had higher risk of worse outcomes. Identifying these patients may aid during transition.",20201019,86,2,10.1097/QAI.0000000000002539,1944-7884

Hepatitis B and C are implicated with a high risk for chronicity, whereas hepatitis A and hepatitis E have an acute course. In pre-existing viral disease, pregnancy may lead to exacerbation of the disease's course due to a plethora of hormonal, immunological and genetic alterations. Vice versa, viral hepatitis, acute or chronic, during pregnancy, can cause gestational complications that may lead to significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Mother to child transmission of hepatitis B and C virus, in high prevalence areas, has been recognized as a major cause of chronic viral infection and related complications in children. Due to the physiologic alterations in pregnancy, therapeutic indications may differ from those in the general population and there is an expanding field of research on available drugs and vaccines efficacy and safety during pregnancy. Of utmost importance remains the implementation of a preventive strategy in order to reduce the rates of vertical transmission.

Até os primeiros 7 dias após o parto aproximadamente, o leite excretado da mama é conhecido como colostro, um fluído de menor volume e rico em compostos imunológicos. Esse leite é responsável por fornecer nutrição ideal para o crescimento e desenvolvimento saudável dos bebês, bem como garantir a proteção e o desenvolvimento adequado do sistema imune do recém-nascido. Entretanto, alguns fatores maternos como a Diabetes Mellitus Gestacional (DMG), pode vir a alterar a concentração de citocinas e quimiocinas presentes no colostro. Nesse contexto, torna-se importante avaliar as alterações nas concentrações desses biomarcadores na presença da doença, uma vez que essas mudanças podem afetar o desenvolvimento do sistema imune do recém-nascido. Objetivo: O presente trabalho tem por objetivo avaliar se a ocorrência de DMG modifica a concentração de citocinas e quimiocinas presentes no colostro. Métodos: Estudo transversal, realizado com dois grupos de mulheres internadas no pós-parto imediato em uma Maternidade referência em Belo Horizonte. Os grupos foram separados de forma que em um deles todas as participantes apresentaram gestação saudável, e o outro grupo apresentou DMG. Foram coletados dados socioeconômicos, de saúde e antropométricos através da caderneta da gestante e avaliação no pós-parto. Também no pós-parto, foi coletado em ambos os grupos uma média de 2mL de colostro para análise da concentração das citocinas/quimiocinas por imunoensaio multiplex. Resultados: Foram incluídas no estudo 25 mulheres, sendo que 56% delas apresentaram uma gestação de risco habitual e 44% DMG. A média e desvio padrão da idade entre elas foi calculada para o grupo risco habitual e DMG respectivamente (24,86±5,26) e (30,09±6,25). No grupo DMG, observou-se aumento na concentração de IL-10, IFN-ï§ e IL-15 no colostro. Numa avaliação global, percebeu-se que o colostro das mulheres com DMG apresentam uma concentração mais alta de agentes inflamatórios, e também dos anti-inflamatórios e que há uma correlação positiva entre as citocinas e quimiocinas nesse grupo. Conclusão: Nessa perspectiva, os dados obtidos no trabalho suportam a idéia de que a doença leva a alterações imunes no colostro, sugerindo que no grupo DMG há um aumento global de citocinas e quimiocinas",20220704,,,,

Both forms of preeclampsia have been associated with maternal systemic inflammation. However, alterations in the placental immune system have been less well characterized. Here, we studied immunological alterations in early- and late-onset preeclampsia placentas using a targeted expression profile approach. RNA was extracted from snap-frozen placenta samples (healthy n=13, early-onset preeclampsia n=13, and late-onset preeclampsia n=6). The expression of 730 immune-related genes from the Pan Cancer Immune Profiling Panel was measured, and the data were analyzed in the advanced analysis module of nSolver software (NanoString Technology). The results showed that early-onset preeclampsia placentas displayed reduced expression of complement, and toll-like receptor (TLR) associated genes, specifically TLR1 and TLR4. Mast cells and M2 macrophages were also decreased in early-onset preeclampsia compared to healthy placentas. The findings were confirmed by an immunohistochemistry approach using 20 healthy, 19 early-onset preeclampsia, and 10 late-onset preeclampsia placentas. We conclude that the placental innate immune system is altered in early-onset preeclampsia compared to uncomplicated pregnancies. The absence of these alterations in late-onset preeclampsia placentas indicates dissimilar immunological profiles.

The reported anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitoxicant, neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, antiapoptotic, antiangiogenic, anti-hypertensive, and antidiabetic properties of curcumin appear to be encouraging, not only for the management of pregnancy-related disorders, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia (PE), depression, preterm birth, and fetal growth disorders but also to contrast damage induced by natural and chemical toxic agents. The current review summarizes the latest data, mostly obtained from animal models and in vitro studies, on the impact of curcumin on the molecular mechanisms involved in pregnancy pathophysiology, with the aim to shed light on the possible beneficial and/or adverse effects of curcumin on pregnancy outcomes.",20201021,12,10,10.3390/nu12103179,2072-6643

","Evol Med Public Health","MEDLINE","article","en","2020","","GB","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7502269","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Among placental mammals, females undergo immunological shifts during pregnancy to accommodate the fetus (i.e. fetal tolerance). Fetal tolerance has primarily been characterized within post-industrial populations experiencing evolutionarily novel conditions (e.g. reduced pathogen exposure), which may shape maternal response to fetal antigens. This study investigates how ecological conditions affect maternal immune status during pregnancy by comparing the direction and magnitude of immunological changes associated with each trimester among the Tsimane (a subsistence population subjected to high pathogen load) and women in the USA. METHODOLOGY: Data from the Tsimane Health and Life History Project (N = 935) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N = 1395) were used to estimate population-specific effects of trimester on differential leukocyte count and C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation. RESULTS: In both populations, pregnancy was associated with increased neutrophil prevalence, reduced lymphocyte and eosinophil count and elevated CRP. Compared to their US counterparts, pregnant Tsimane women exhibited elevated lymphocyte and eosinophil counts, fewer neutrophils and monocytes and lower CRP. Total leukocyte count remained high and unchanged among pregnant Tsimane women while pregnant US women exhibited substantially elevated counts, resulting in overlapping leukocyte prevalence among all third-trimester individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our findings indicate that ecological conditions shape non-pregnant immune baselines and the magnitude of immunological shifts during pregnancy via developmental constraints and current trade-offs. Future research should investigate how such flexibility impacts maternal health and disease susceptibility, particularly the degree to which chronic pathogen exposure might dampen inflammatory response to fetal antigens. LAY SUMMARY: This study compares immunological changes associated with pregnancy between the Tsimane (an Amazonian subsistence population) and individuals in the USA. Results suggest that while pregnancy enhances non-specific defenses and dampens both antigen-specific immunity and parasite/allergy response, ecological conditions strongly influence immune baselines and the magnitude of shifts during gestation.",20200928,2020,1,10.1093/emph/eoaa022,2050-6201

This study was designed to establish whether the mung bean water extract, which contains prostaglandins that can regulate corpus luteum maturation, provided any benefits to liver metabolism after the dynamic hormonal change associated with pregnancy. Female C57BL/6J mice were used, and all mice received daily injections of progesterone (5.0 mg/kg) for 5 days, after which progesterone was withdrawn for 3 days. Gel-free/label-free proteomic analysis revealed that the abundance of several proteins was affected in the liver. Hormone manipulation induced changes in lipid metabolism-related protein abundance; oral administration of mung bean coat extract (MBC) for 3 days mitigated the changes and downregulated the expression of Cpt1&#945;, Akr1ß, and Srebp1 in the liver.

Host immunity and maternal stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of sPTB but mechanisms are poorly delineated. Antimicrobial proteins in the cervicovaginal space, such as beta defensins, modulate immune responses to bacteria and have been shown to modulate the risk of sPTB from non-optimal microbiota. While stress is known to induce immunological changes, no study has examined the interplay between maternal stress and the immune response in association with sPTB. Objectives: Our objectives were to determine whether psychosocial stress was associated with a mediator of the immune system in the cervicovaginal space, beta defensin-2, and to examine the combined impact of high stress and low cervicovaginal beta defensin-2 levels on the odds of sPTB. Study Design: From the Motherhood & Microbiome cohort study (n=2000), we performed a secondary, nested case-control study, frequency matched by race/ethnicity, of 519 pregnant women (110 sPTB and 409 term). Stress and cervicovaginal beta defensin-2 levels were measured at 16-20 weeks of gestation. Stress was dichotomized at a score of 30 on Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). We measured cervicovaginal beta defensin-2 levels with ELISA and dichotomized at the median. We modeled associations of high stress and low cervicovaginal beta defensin-2 levels using multivariable logistic regression. We also compared the proportion of women with high stress and low cervicovaginal beta defensin-2 levels among women with spontaneous preterm and term births using Chi-Square tests. We modeled adjusted associations of stress and cervicovaginal beta defensin-2 levels with odds of sPTB using logistic regression. Results: The majority of the study population was non-Hispanic black (72.8%), insured by Medicaid (51.1%), and had a PSS-14 score < 30 (80.2%). High stress was associated with reduced adjusted odds of low beta defensin-2 levels (aOR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.38 -0.99). In a model adjusted for race and smoking, both high stress (aOR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.03-2.90) and low beta defensin-2 (aOR 1.58, 95% CI: 1.004-2.49) were associated with increased odds of sPTB. We then built a model of the four possible combinations of low and high stress and low and high beta defensin-2 levels with the odds of sPTB. Women with either high stress (aOR 1.37, 95% CI: 0.68 - 2.78) or low beta defensin-2 (aOR 1.40, 95% CI: 0.83-2.34), had slightly elevated but not significantly increased odds of sPTB compared to women with neither exposure. However, women with both high stress and low beta defensin-2 had significantly elevated odds of sPTB compared to women with neither exposure (aOR 3.16, 95 % CI: 1.46 - 6.84). Conclusion: High perceived stress and low cervicovaginal beta defensin-2 levels are associated with higher odds of sPTB, and when present concurrently, they result in the highest odds of sPTB in a largely non-Hispanic black cohort. Our findings warrant further work to examine social determinants of health and the host cervicovaginal immune responses that may modulate the pathogenesis of sPTB.",20200717,2,2,10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100092,2589-9333

However, the existing literature does not sufficiently elucidate the pathophysiology of this clinical entity which appears in such a crucial period of woman's life. This review aims to search the available data regarding the involvement of immunological and autoimmune mechanisms in its onset. A literature review was conducted using web-based search engines provided by PubMed (for Medline database) and Google Scholar. Manuscripts in English and Greek language were included for the period 19902017. Nowadays, a large body of evidence indicates that depressive disorders are accompanied by activated neuro-immune, neuro-oxidative and neuro-nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways. However, clinical research regarding the biological mechanisms associated with PPD is a tough challenge as pregnancy and puerperium are periods of adaptive changes in pregnant women by definition. Two of the systems that have been studied as potentially contributing to the onset of PPD are: the activation of the Inflammatory Response System (IRS) and the deregulation of the Hypothalamic-PituitaryAdrenal axis (HPA). Controversial data indicate dysregulation of cytokines and other inflammatory agents in patients with PPD, as well as, a close correlation of immune-inflammatory mechanisms and kynurenine pathway. PPD has been closely associated with autoimmune diseases. It is notable that this entity shares many common traits with autoimmune diseases such as the genetic susceptibility, family history, the high correlation with other autoimmune diseases, clinical exacerbations and remissions, women's superiority in prevalence, and the possible re-occurrence during a future pregnancy. These facts suggest that the typical postpartum flare pattern, and other clinical characteristics, point towards an autoimmune etiology for PPD.

Patologia materna ou alteração genética de natureza cromossômica, em um dos progenitores, são fatores de risco favoráveis a esses acontecimentos. Outras situações que podem estar relacionadas às alterações cromossômicas são a infertilidade e a ocorrência de mola hidatiforme (neoplasia trofoblástica gestacional), caracterizada por interferência na formação e desenvolvimento do embrião. Embora haja um consenso sobre o caráter multifatorial das perdas gestacionais, incluindo componentes anatômicos, imunológicos, endócrinos, genéticos e ambientais, ainda assim, a causalidade pode permanecer desconhecida. Objetivos: analisar e quantificar achados de dificuldades reprodutivas relacionados a presença de alterações cromossômicas encontrados no serviço de genética realizado pelo programa Genética & Sociedade, do Instituto de Biologia da Universidade Federal da Bahia. Metodologia: estudo descritivo e analítico, realizado por meio de consulta a fichas de anamneses, preenchidas durante o atendimento de casais, que buscaram o serviço de genética comunitária para aconselhamento genético no período de vinte anos. Resultados: entre os 73 casais selecionados para estudo, 59 (80,8%) relataram abortos recorrentes, 9 (12,3%) tinham histórico de mola hidatiforme e 5 (6,8%) apresentaram infertilidade.

The aim of this study was to describe reasons of MS treatment modifications in a large cohort of Italian MS patients. METHODS: this multicenter, cross-sectional non interventional study (SWITCH) conducted at 28 Italian MS centers, screened, by visit/telephone contact between June 2016 and June 2017, all RRMS patients receiving stable DMT treatment and enrolled patients with change in DMT treatment. RESULTS: out of 13,657 recorded in the log, 409 (3%) changed therapy. Of these, 336 (2.5%), met the study criteria and were considered eligible. Among 303 (90.2% of 336) patients switching, the most common reason was ""lack of efficacy"" (58.4% of 303). Among 30 (8.9%) patients who interrupted treatment temporarily, the most common reason was pregnancy (40.0% of 30). Out of 3 (0.9%) patients who discontinued treatment permanently, 2 (66.7%) had as first reason as ""patient decision"". Multivariate analysis showed that EDSS was the only variable with statistically significant effect on changing treatments (r = 8.33; p-value of Type III Sum of Squares = 0.016).

Indeed, since the completion of the Human Microbiome Project, insight and interest in the role of microbiota in health and disease, also through study of its combined genomes, the microbiome, has been steadily expanding. One less explored field of microbiome research has been the female reproductive tract. Research mainly from the past decade suggests that microbial communities residing in the reproductive tract represent a large proportion of the female microbial network and appear to be involved in reproductive failure and pregnancy complications. Microbiome research is facing technological and methodological challenges, as detection techniques and analysis methods are far from being standardized. A further hurdle is understanding the complex host-microbiota interaction and the confounding effect of a multitude of constitutional and environmental factors. A key regulator of this interaction is the maternal immune system that, during the peri-conceptional stage and even more so during pregnancy, undergoes considerable modulation. This review aims to summarize the current literature on reproductive tract microbiota describing the composition of microbiota in different anatomical locations (vagina, cervix, endometrium, and placenta). We also discuss putative mechanisms of interaction between such microbial communities and various aspects of the immune system, with a focus on the characteristic immunological changes during normal pregnancy. Furthermore, we discuss how abnormal microbiota composition, ""dysbiosis,"" is linked to a spectrum of clinical disorders related to the female reproductive system and how the maternal immune system is involved.

Evidence regarding causes of the high prevalence and incidence of thyroid autoimmunity in women, and especially women of reproductive age, is still inconclusive and previous studies have suggested genetic, environmental, and existential factors to play a role in its pathogenesis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of parity and other reproductive factors on the incidence of thyroid autoimmunity within the framework of the Tehran Thyroid Study (TTS). Materials and Methods: This study was conducted within the framework of the TTS and 1999 nonpregnant euthyroid thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) negative women were followed up for an average of 8.3 years. A pooled logistic regression model was used to assess the association (odds ratio) between time-dependent covariates parity, menopause, and abortion, and incidence of TPOAb positivity. Results: The total incidence rate of TPOAb positivity was 8.65 [7.35-10.18] per 1000 person-years. We found no significant association between changes in the number of parity and risk of developing TPOAb using multiple pooled logistic models both as crude effect and after adjustment for age, body mass index, and smoking. Similarly, there was no association between changes of parity, menopause, and abortion status, and incidence of TPOAb positivity. Conclusions: Parity does not seem to have an independent role in triggering thyroid autoimmunity, but vast immunological and physiological changes during pregnancy may act as a precipitating factor in the context of other genetic and environmental modifiers.",20200312,30,8,10.1089/thy.2019.0440,1557-9077

Effective therapeutic treatment of this condition has been hampered by the unknown etiology and lack of understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie idiopathic oligohydramnios. Amniotic fluid volume (AFV) is determined by intramembranous (IM) transport of amniotic fluid across the amnion and this pathway is regulated to maintain AFV within the normal range. To gain understanding of the causes of idiopathic oligohydramnios, we performed proteomics analysis of the human amnion to investigate the changes in protein expression profiles of cellular transport pathways and regulators in patients with oligohydramnios. Placental amnions from five patients with normal pregnancies and five patients with oligohydramnios were subjected to proteomics experiments followed by bioinformatics analysis. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software, five categories of biological functions and multiple canonical pathways within each category were revealed. The top differentially expressed proteins that participate in mediating these pathways were identified. The functional pathways activated include: (a) cellular assembly and organization, (b) cell signaling and energy metabolism, and (c) immunological, infectious, and inflammatory functions. Furthermore, the analysis identified the category of pathways that facilitate molecular endocytosis and vesicular uptake. Under oligohydramniotic conditions, the mediators of clathrin vesicle-mediated uptake and transport as well as intracellular trafficking mediators were up-regulated. These findings suggest that idiopathic oligohydramnios may be associated with alternations in cellular organization and immunological functions as well as increases in activity of vesicular transport pathways across the amnion.",20200229,8,4,10.14814/phy2.14381,2051-817X

Compared with mature milk, it has a high concentration of immunoglobulin G. Calves are born without circulating antibodies, thus ingestion of colostrum is necessary to protect the calf against pathogens in the first challenging weeks of life. In addition to the life-saving supply of antibodies, colostrum contains minerals, vitamins, growth factors, and immune cells. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) were added to that list. MicroRNAs are short, non-coding RNA molecules that can regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. They are thought to act as key regulators of diverse biological and developmental processes. Colostrum contains higher amounts of miRNAs than mature milk; immune- and development-related miRNAs are prominent. Their expression pattern in milk is likely to be influenced by maternal nutrition and environment. The fat content of the maternal diet appears to have a major effect on expression of miRNAs in milk and in the neonate. The immunological state of the mammary gland seems to affect miRNA expression as well. In cows diagnosed with subclinical mastitis, alterations in the expression of miRNAs in milk have been observed. It is believed that miRNAs in colostrum and milk are signaling molecules passed from mother to newborn. They are packaged in extracellular vesicles, which makes them resistant to the harsh conditions in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, they can reach the small intestine, where they are absorbed and transferred into the bloodstream. MicroRNAs are important for the development of the intestines. For example, miRNAs stimulate cell viability, proliferation, and stem cell activity of the intestinal epithelium. Furthermore, miRNAs seem to act as key players in the development of the complete immune system. They can, among other things, regulate B- and T-cell differentiation and affect interleukin production of macrophages. The abundance of miRNAs in colostrum and milk and the possibility for their absorption in the intestines of the neonate supports the hypothesis that these tiny molecules are important for the development of the newborn. The probable relation of diet to the expression of miRNAs by the mother creates a possible avenue to optimize expression of miRNAs and improve neonatal maturation.",20191104,103,1,10.3168/jds.2019-16959,1525-3198

COVID-19 is the potential to transmit either mother to fetus or mother/caregiver to neonates. However, neonates born from infected mothers did not show significant clinical features. Pharyngeal-swab, amniotic-fluid, cord-blood, and breast-milk test results were not found positive. Health facility-based vaginal/caesarian delivery was considered a low risk of transmission. However, recommended to separate neonates with infected mothers/caregivers and test immediately after birth to avoid the possible transmission. Mothers/caregivers should take routine preventive measures such as washing hands frequently and avoiding contact with infected people. If neonates suffered from the server acute respiratory distress requires intensive care urgently.

Most studies of the prenatal microbiota have focused on the vagina, with fewer investigating other body sites during pregnancy. Although pregnancy involves profound hormonal, immunological and metabolic changes, few studies have investigated either shifts in microbiota composition across pregnancy at different body sites or variation in composition at any site that may be explained by maternal characteristics. The purpose of this study was to investigate: (1) the stability of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiota from early (8-14 weeks) through later (24-30 weeks) pregnancy among African American women according to measures of socioeconomic status, accounting for prenatal antibiotic use; (2) whether measures of socioeconomic status are associated with changes in microbiota composition over pregnancy; and (3) whether exposure to prenatal antibiotics mediate any observed associations between measures of socioeconomic status and stability of the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiota across pregnancy. Methods: We used paired vaginal, oral, or gut samples available for 16S rRNA gene sequencing from two time points in pregnancy (8-14 and 24-30 weeks) to compare within-woman changes in measures of alpha diversity (Shannon and Chao1) and beta-diversity (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) among pregnant African American women (n = 110). Multivariable linear regression was used to examine the effect of level of education and prenatal health insurance as explanatory variables for changes in diversity, considering antibiotic exposure as a mediator, adjusting for age, obstetrical history, and weeks between sampling. Results: For the oral and gut microbiota, there were no significant associations between measures of socioeconomic status or prenatal antibiotic use and change in Shannon or Chao1 diversity. For the vaginal microbiota, low level of education (high school or less) was associated with an increase in Shannon and Chao1 diversity over pregnancy, with minimal attenuation when controlling for prenatal antibiotic use. Conversely, for within-woman Bray-Curtis dissimilarity for early compared to later pregnancy, low level of education and prenatal antibiotics were associated with greater dissimilarity for the oral and gut sites, with minimal attenuation when controlling for prenatal antibiotics, and no difference in dissimilarity for the vaginal site. Conclusions: Measures of maternal socioeconomic status are variably associated with changes in diversity across pregnancy for the vaginal, oral, and gut microbiota, with minimal attenuation by prenatal antibiotic exposure.

The Missed opportunities for maternal and infant health (MOMI) EU-funded project has implemented a package of interventions at community and facility levels to uptake maternal and infant postpartum care (PPC). One of these interventions is the integration of maternal PPC in child clinics and infant immunization services, which proved to be successful for improving maternal and infant PPC. AIM: Taking stock of the progress achieved in terms of PPC with the implementation of the interventions, this paper assesses the economic cost of maternal PPC services, for health services and households, before and after the project start in Kaya health district (Burkina Faso). METHODS: PPC costs to health services are estimated using secondary data on personnel and infrastructure and primary data on time allocation. Data from two household surveys collected before and after one year intervention among mothers within one year PP are used to estimate the household cost of maternal PPC visits. We also compare PPC costs for households and health services with or without integration. We focus on the costs of the PPC intervention at days 6-10 that was most successful. RESULTS: The average unit cost of health services for days 6-10 maternal PPC decreased from 4.6 USD before the intervention in 2013 (Jan-June) to 3.5 USD after the intervention implementation in 2014. Maternal PPC utilization increased with the implementation of the interventions but so did days 6-10 household mean costs. Similarly, the household costs increased with the integration of maternal PPC to BCG immunization. CONCLUSION: In the context of growing reproductive health expenditures from many funding sources in Burkina Faso, the uptake of maternal PPC led to a cost reduction, as shown for days 6-10, at health services level. Further research should determine whether the increase in costs for households would be deterrent to the use of integrated maternal and infant PPC.",20191017,18,1,10.1186/s12939-019-1064-5,1475-9276

Discrimination based on race may contribute to these disparities, but the biological pathways through which racial discrimination acts on health are not fully known. Even less is known about these pathways during development. Examining how racial discrimination becomes biology is paramount because it may shed light on how and when such social forces result in lasting biological consequences for health and wellbeing. To begin exploring this issue, we performed a systematic review of the relationships between experiences of chronic racial discrimination and relevant biomarkers measured during pregnancy among African American women. The literature search included studies published prior to August 2018 in the MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases, and 11 studies met our inclusion criteria. We evaluated the articles based on the biological system that the authors investigated, which included the immune, neuroendocrine, and cardiovascular systems. We found that the current literature provides preliminary evidence that experiences of chronic racial discrimination are associated with changes in maternal biology during pregnancy. However, the literature was limited in both quantity and quality. We found only 11 studies that addressed this subject, four of which only provided indirect evidence, and many studies had small sample sizes.

In the first part, we described the discovery of unique physiological modifications of the uteroplacental spiral arteries, enabling them to cope with a major increase in blood flow necessary to ensure proper growth of the fetus. These consist of an invasion of the arterial walls by trophoblast and a progressive disappearance of its normal structure. Researchers then turned to the pathophysiology of the placental bed and in particular to its maternal vascular tree. This yielded vital information for a better understanding of the so-called great obstetrical syndromes (preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, premature labor and delivery, placenta accreta). Systematic morphological investigations of the uteroplacental vasculature showed that preeclampsia is associated with decreased or failed transformation of spiral arteries and the persistence of endothelial and smooth muscle cells in segments of their myometrial portion. Here we report on recent functional investigations of the placental bed, including in situ biophysical studies of uteroplacental blood flow and vascular resistance, and manipulation of uteroplacental perfusion. These new methodologies have provided a novel way of identifying pregnancies in which remodeling is impaired. In animals it is now possible to manipulate uteroplacental blood flow, leading to an enhancement of fetal growth; this opens the way to trials in abnormal human pregnancies. In this second part, we explored a new, extremely important area of research that deals with the role of specific subsets of leukocytes and macrophages in the placental bed. The human first-trimester decidua is rich in leukocytes called uterine natural killer cells. Both macrophages and uterine natural killer cells increase in number from the secretory endometrium to early pregnancy and play a critical role in mediating the process of spiral artery transformation by inducing initial structural changes. It seems therefore that vascular remodeling of spiral arteries is initiated independently of trophoblast invasion. Dysregulation of the immune system may lead to reproductive failure or pregnancy complications, and in this respect, recent studies have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms regulating immunological tolerance during pregnancy, with several mechanisms being proposed for the development of tolerance to the semiallogeneic fetus. In particular, these include several strategies by which the trophoblast avoids maternal recognition. Finally, an important new dimension is being explored: the likelihood that pregnancy syndromes and impaired uteroplacental vascular remodeling may be linked to future maternal and even the child's cardiovascular disease risk. The functional evidence underlying these observations will be discussed.",20190710,221,5,10.1016/j.ajog.2019.07.010,1097-6868

It has been demonstrated that endometriosis, in particular, is known to result in subfertility but endometriosis and adenomyosis are increasingly linked to late pregnancy complications such as those caused by placental insufficiency. At the molecular level, the presence of ectopic endometrium perturbs the endometrial hormonal, cellular, and immunological milieu, negatively influencing decidualization, placentation, and developmental programming of the embryo. It is unclear if and how such early aberrant reproductive development relates to pregnancy outcomes in endometriosis and adenomyosis. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to (i) investigate the association of adenomyosis and endometriosis with fertility, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes of women through both assisted reproduction and natural conception and (ii) determine whether endometriosis disease subtypes have specific impacts on different stages of the reproductive process. SEARCH METHODS: A systematic literature review of NHS evidence electronic databases and the Cochrane database identified all comparative and observational studies between 1980 and December 2018 in any language on adenomyosis and endometriosis with fertility, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes (23 search terms used). A total of 104 papers were selected for data extraction and meta-analysis, with use of Downs and Black standardized checklist to evaluate quality and bias. OUTCOMES: We found that endometriosis consistently leads to reduced oocyte yield and a reduced fertilization rate (FR), in line with current evidence. Milder forms of endometriosis were most likely to affect the fertilization (FR OR 0.77, CI 0.63-0.93) and earlier implantation processes (implantation rate OR 0.76, CI 0.62-0.93). The more severe disease by American Society for Reproductive Medicine staging (ASRM III and IV) influenced all stages of reproduction. Ovarian endometriosis negatively affects the oocyte yield (MD -1.22, CI -1.96, -0.49) and number of mature oocytes (MD -2.24, CI -3.4, -1.09). We found an increased risk of miscarriage in both adenomyosis and endometriosis (OR 3.40, CI 1.41-8.65 and OR 1.30, CI 1.25-1.35, respectively), and endometriosis can be associated with a range of obstetric and fetal complications including preterm delivery (OR 1.38, CI 1.01-1.89), caesarean section delivery (OR 1.98 CI 1.64-2.38), and neonatal unit admission following delivery (OR 1.29, CI 1.07-1.55). WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Adenomyosis and the subtypes of endometriosis may have specific complication profiles though further evidence is needed to be able to draw conclusions. Several known pregnancy complications are likely to be associated with these conditions. The complications are possibly caused by dysfunctional uterine changes leading to implantation and placentation issues and therefore could potentially have far-reaching consequences as suggested by Barker's hypothesis. Our findings would suggest that women with these conditions should ideally receive pre-natal counselling and should be considered higher risk in pregnancy and at delivery, until evidence to the contrary is available. In order to expand our knowledge of these conditions and better advise on future management of these patients in reproductive and maternal medicine, a more unified approach to studying fertility and reproductive outcomes with longer term follow-up of the offspring and attention to the subtype of disease is necessary.",20190719,25,5,10.1093/humupd/dmz012,1460-2369

Tumours often present characteristics of high malignancy and are hormone receptor negative/HER2 positive or triple negative. In general, pregnancy, including the postpartum period, is associated with a transiently increased risk of developing breast cancer but followed by a long-lasting protective period. Placental metastases are very rare and, thus far, breast cancer metastases in the foetal compartment have not been described. To discuss these apparently contradictory observations, this narrative review resumes immunological and hormonal alterations during pregnancy potentially affecting breast cancer risk as well as tumour growth and behaviour. OBSERVATIONS: Upregulation of breast cancer-associated genes involved in immunological and reproductive processes has been observed in parous women and is potentially responsible for a transiently increased risk in pregnancy. In contrast, maternal immunisation and immunoglobulin production against antigens expressed on trophoblast cells, such as specific glycosylation patterns of mucin-1 or RCAS1-associated truncated glycans, seem to prevent breast cancer development in later years. Animal and human studies indicate that T cells are involved in these processes. Several placenta-derived factors, especially kisspeptin, have direct anti-tumour effects. The pregnancy-related increase of estrogen, progesterone, and other hormones influence growth and characteristics of breast cancer while the role of further placenta-secreted factors is still controversially discussed. CONCLUSION: Several factors and cells are involved in altered breast cancer risk during and after pregnancy and have potential for developing novel treatment strategies in future.",20190524,115,,10.1016/j.ejca.2019.03.021,1879-0852

Therefore, oocyte donation pregnancies result in an immunologically challenging pregnancy, which is reflected by a higher-than-normal risk to develop pre-eclampsia. Based on the allogeneic conditions in oocyte donation pregnancies, we hypothesized that this situation may translate into alterations in concentration of stable readouts of constituents of the reactive species interactome (RSI) compared to normal pregnancies, especially serum free thiols, nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) related metabolites. Indeed, total free thiol levels and nitrite (NO2-) concentrations were significantly lower whereas protein-bound NO and sulfate (SO42-) concentrations were significantly higher in both oocyte donation and naturally conceived pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia. The increased concentrations of nitrite observed in uncomplicated oocyte donation pregnancies suggest that endothelial NO production is compensatorily enhanced to lower vascular tone.

Whilst HCMV primary infection and periodic reactivation is well controlled by T cell responses in healthy people, when the immune system is compromised such as post-transplantation, during pregnancy, or underdeveloped such as in new-born infants and children, CMV disease can be a significant problem. In older people, HCMV infection is associated with increased risk of mortality and despite overt disease rarely being seen there are increases in HCMV-DNA in urine of older people suggesting that there is a change in the efficacy of the T cell response following lifelong infection. Therefore, understanding whether phenomenon such as ""memory inflation"" of the immune response is occurring in humans and if this is detrimental to the overall health of individuals would enable the development of appropriate treatment strategies for the future. In this review, we present the evidence available from human studies regarding the development and maintenance of memory CD8 + and CD4 + T cell responses to HCMV.

Another group of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane are the voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channels. We examined if a change in immunological tolerance is accompanied by altered ORAI, STIM and CaV gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in pregnant women and in type 1 diabetic individuals. Our results show that in pregnancy and type 1 diabetes ORAI1-3 are up-regulated whereas STIM1 and 2 are down-regulated in pregnancy but only STIM2 in type 1 diabetes. Expression of L-, P/Q-, R- and T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels was detected in the PBMCs where the CaV2.3 gene was up-regulated in pregnancy and type 1 diabetes whereas the CaV 2.1 and CaV3.2 genes were up-regulated only in pregnancy and the CaV1.3 gene in type 1 diabetes. The results are consistent with that expression of ORAI, STIM and CaV genes correlate with a shift in immunological status of the individual in health, as during pregnancy, and in the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes. Whether the changes are in general protective or in type 1 diabetes include some pathogenic components remains to be clarified.",20181214,13,12,10.1371/journal.pone.0208981,1932-6203

Recent findings have linked cancer (ie, tumor) risk to increased tissue-specific stem cell division and self-renewal and suggest that somatic mutations in myometrial stem cells (MyoSCs) convert them into tumor-initiating cells, leading to UF. Specifically, preliminary results in paraffin-embedded myometrial tissues have shown increased STRO-1+/CD44+ MyoSCs in African American versus Caucasian women. Using specific methods of flow cytometry and automated quantitative pathology imaging, a large cohort of myometrial samples were investigated to determine how the STRO-1+/CD44+ MyoSCs change with regard to a patient's race, age, parity, fibroid and hormone statuses, and the location of UFs within the uterus. We confirmed that the STRO-1+/CD44+ MyoSC population is expanded in African American women, is correlated with parity and fibroid number, and fluctuates with cyclic menstrual cycle hormone changes and age.

The effects of maternal inflammation on offspring from the perspective of the inflammatory response and immune changes are not fully understood. We hypothesized that maternal inflammation modulates immune and metabolic functions, affecting the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases in offspring. This study investigated whether maternal inflammation affects the onset of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a murine model of human rheumatoid arthritis. Female DBA/1J mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 5 days before conception. Male offspring of LPS-treated dams were placed in the maternal LPS group (MLG). To induce CIA, type II collagen (CII) was emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected twice into each mouse, at 13 and 16 weeks. The offspring were sacrificed at 26 weeks to analyze immunological and metabolic parameters. The degree of joint swelling at an early stage of CIA was lower in the MLG than in the control group. From histological analysis, the severity of joint destruction (severity of arthritis score) and CII-specific IgG titer were significantly lower in the MLG. However, at 26 weeks, serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels, an index of CIA disease activity, were significantly higher in the MLG. Moreover, serum leptin levels were lower in the MLG, and a negative correlation between leptin and serum IL-6 was observed. In conclusion, maternal inflammation does not merely suppress inflammation; it may delay CIA in offspring. The analysis of inflammatory cytokines and leptin concentrations at 26 weeks suggests that the pathophysiology of arthritis was worsening. This study also suggests that maternal inflammation modulates postnatal inflammatory response patterns in offspring.",20180629,41,5,10.1007/s10753-018-0827-2,1573-2576

We applied transcriptome-wide screens to 149 umbilical cord blood samples from neonates born to mothers with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; nâ¯=â¯20), depression (nâ¯=â¯31) and PTSD with comorbid depression (nâ¯=â¯13), compared to carefully matched trauma exposed controls (nâ¯=â¯23) and healthy mothers (nâ¯=â¯62). Analyses by maternal diagnoses revealed a clear pattern of gene expression signatures distinguishing neonates born to mothers with a history of psychopathology from those without. Co-expression network analysis identified distinct gene expression perturbations across maternal diagnoses, including two depression-related modules implicated in axon-guidance and mRNA stability, as well as two PTSD-related modules implicated in TNF signaling and cellular response to stress. Notably, these disease-related modules were enriched with brain-expressed genes and genetic risk loci for autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, which may imply a causal role for impaired developmental outcomes. These molecular alterations preceded changes in clinical measures at twenty-four months, including reductions in cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes in affected infants.

The concept of maternal ""weathering"" captures cumulative somatic and psychological adversities that can exacerbate the effects of aging. Much of the evidence for weathering comes from observational studies linking self-report measures with reproductive outcomes. The purpose of this review is to explore biological mechanisms that underlie these observations. We focus on spontaneous abortion because this event is understudied despite evidence of racial disparities in this outcome. Spontaneous abortion is the most common pregnancy failure, and it happens early in pregnancy. Early pregnancy is a time most susceptible to the harmful effects of immune dysregulation that may, in part, result from adversities experienced before pregnancy begins. In exploring these mechanisms, we draw on well-defined signaling processes observed in the stressor-depression relationship. Pro-inflammatory dysregulation, for example, has particular relevance to immunological control occurring early in pregnancy. Early pregnancy immunologic changes affect the trajectories of pregnancy via control of trophoblastic invasion. Within the first few weeks of pregnancy, uterine derived cytokines operate within cytokine networks and play a critical role in this invasion. Programming for pro-inflammatory dysregulation can occur before conception. This dysregulation, brought into early pregnancy, has implications for viability and success of the index pregnancy. These patterns suggest early pregnancy health is susceptible to stress processing pathways that influence this immunologic control in the first six to eight weeks of pregnancy. In this review, we discuss the known mediating role of immune factors in the stressor-depression relationship. We also discuss how adversity experienced before the index pregnancy, or ""pre-pregnancy"" may influence these pathways, and subsequently influence early pregnancy health. There is a need to understand adversity, experienced before pregnancy, and mechanisms driving the effects of these experiences on pregnancy outcomes. This approach is a useful entry point for understanding racial inequities in pregnancy health through an understanding of differences in exposures to adversity. We hypothesize that spontaneous abortion involves cyclical changes within a woman's reproductive tract in response to stressors that are established well before a woman enters into pregnancy. Furthermore, we propose mechanisms that potentially drive weathering processes relevant to reproductive disparities. We also examine what is known about pre-pregnancy stress exposures associated with race, inequity, and adversity, and their potential impact on neuroendocrine and immune changes affecting early pregnancy risk.",20180410,92,,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.03.001,1873-3360

In this review, we will evaluate the role of the mammary microenvironment in mastitis in humans, ruminants and rabbits, where appropriate also drawing on studies utilising laboratory animal models. We will examine subclinical mastitis, clinical lactational mastitis, and involution-associated, or dry period, mastitis, highlighting important anatomical and immunological species differences. We will synthesise knowledge gained across different species, comparing and contrasting disease presentation. Subclinical mastitis (SCM) is characterised by elevated Na/K ratio, and increased milk IL-8 concentrations. SCM affecting the breastfeeding mother may result in modulation of infant mucosal immune system development, whilst in ruminants notable milk production losses may ensue. In the case of clinical lactational mastitis, we will focus on mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Understanding of the pathogenesis of involution-associated mastitis requires characterization of the structural and molecular changes occurring during involution and we will review these changes across species. We speculate that milk accumulation may act as a nidus for infection, and that the involution 'wound healing phenotype' may render the tissue susceptible to bacterial infection. We will discuss the impact of concurrent pregnancy and a 'parallel pregnancy and involution signature' during bovine mammary involution.",20180430,23,1-2,10.1007/s10911-018-9395-1,1573-7039

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of annual, national cross-sectional database of maternal and late maternal deaths, identified through active surveillance of deaths among women aged 10-50 years. SETTING: Jamaica, a middle-income Caribbean country. POPULATION: Maternal and late maternal deaths. METHODS: Descriptive trend analyses of demographic and cause-specific maternal and pregnancy-related mortality ratios undertaken comparing the periods 1998-2003, 2004-2009 and 2010-2015. Multivariate logistic regression was used to confirm changes in risk of indirect death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal, pregnancy-related, direct, indirect and cause-specific mortality ratios (deaths/100 000 live births). RESULTS: Maternal deaths from indirect conditions increased between the first two periods (P = 0.004) and stabilised in the third (P = 0.085). Associated with upward movement in cardiovascular deaths (P[trend] = 0.003), women under 25 years were at elevated risk (odds ratio 1.44, 95% CI 1.00-2.08; P = 0.052).

Health service utilisation was similar across age, parity, health region and major cause categories (non-communicable diseases, non-obstetric infections, direct), however women with indirect conditions spent more time in hospital (median 5 days versus 3 days) and more often died after the puerperium. CONCLUSIONS: Medical conditions, especially cardiovascular disease, are increasingly associated with maternal and late maternal mortality. Middle-income countries need to simultaneously improve management of indirect conditions, while redoubling efforts to reduce direct deaths. Postpuerperal medical services should be integrated into routine infant health services to improve continuity of care during this high-risk period.

With the predominance of androgens against the background of lowering the normal products of steroidogenesis, a pro-inflammatory immune imbalance is formed, which causes a premature termination of the development of pregnancy. Many studies indicate that hyperandrogenism is a factor in the development of obstetric pathology, including placental dysfunction. The severity of obstetric complications of pregnancy in women with hyperandrogenism depends on the duration of the disease and the quality of preparation for pregnancy. Establishing early markers of endocrine hyperandrogenic imbalance in the body of a future mother and conducting timely therapy is the key to the successful completion of pregnancy. The aim: the establishment of hormonal-immunological changes and morphological and receptive structure peculiarities of the endometrium correlations in women with PCOS at the pregnancy planning stage. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: 139 women with PCOS were screened at the stage of pregnancy planning. Diagnosis of PCI was conducted in accordance with the International Recommendations of Endocrine Society 2013 and the Rotterdam criteria of 2003. Endometrial aspiration was studied for the study of T and B lymphocyte populations, cytokine levels and endometrial receptors. Hormonal parameters were determined using the radioimmunological method using Immunotech (Czech Republic) and Siena Ire Sorin (France) kits. Normal values of the studied hormones in accordance with the recommendations of the manufacturer. In order to study the populations of T and B lymphocytes and endometrial receptors the aspirate, obtained by endometrial biopsies, was used taken on the 5-7 and 21-24 days of the menstrual cycle. The cytokines levels (INF-y, TNF-a, Il-4, Il-6, Il-8, Il-10) were estimated in the endometrium with the help of the test system ""Protein contour"" on immunoenzymatic analyzer ""Multyskan EX"" (Germany). The assessment of estrogens receptors at stroma and glands and progesterone receptors at stroma and glands was performed by H -Score system, lymphocytes count was carried out by the light microscope at 400 x 3 fields-of-view expansion. Statistical material analysis was carried out on the personal computer using the standard software package with applied statistical analysis (Excel 2003 and Statistica v. 6.0). The assessment of variables connection was carried out by Pirson's coefficient correlations. The statistical significance of differences was performed by the use of nonparametric Mann -Whitney criteria, &#967;2 and Fisher criterium. The significance threshold of statistical value was considered p = 0.05. RESULTS: Results: In women with hyperandrogenism, there was a significant increase (p <0.05) in the level of DHEA-S, a decrease in the level of E2 and progesterone in the early follicular phase compared with the control group and an increase in body weight by 37.5%. At histological examination of the endometrium on the 5-7th day of the menstrual cycle there was a lag proliferative changes of the endometrium, and in one third of women hyperplastic process against the background of reduced proliferative activity. At GA there was a marked violation of expression of receptors as estrogens and progesterone stroma in all stages of the menstrual cycle. In women with hyperandrogenism, changes in the immunological profile of endometriosis with the prevalence of Th-1 orientation of immunity have been detected. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: In women with hyperandrogenism there is a close correlation between the biochemical form of the domination of androgens, ovulatory dysfunction, immunohistochemical and morphological structure of the endometrium.

Imbalances in the immune system and failure to achieve immune tolerance to the foetus have been implicated as potentially modifiable causes of idiopathic RIF and RPL. As such, women are increasingly being treated with immunomodulatory agents in an attempt to achieve a successful pregnancy. This systematic review examines the published evidence on immune changes in these patients, the use of immunomodulation therapies and diagnostic testing modalities to guide their use or to identify patient subsets most likely to benefit.

The potential for reproduction declines and ceases as the ovaries become depleted of follicles. A transition period in mid-life, for 2 to 10 years, when menstruation is less regular is called the perimenopause. The menopause is associated with a significant decline in plasma concentrations of sex hormones, an increase in the concentrations of the gonadotrophins and changes in other hormones such as the inhibins. These changes are superimposed with effects of aging, social and metabolic factors, daily activity and well-being. Although the menopause is entirely natural, in some cases ovarian failure can occur earlier than usual; this is pathological and warrants careful biochemical investigations to distinguish it from conditions causing infertility. Elderly females are affected by a range of clinical disorders including endocrine, cardiovascular, skeletal, urogenital tract and immunological systems, body mass, vasomotor tone, mood and sleep pattern. Reference intervals for many diagnostic biochemical tests for the menopause need to be used when interpreting results in clinical investigations for patient management.

Pregnancy process is accompanied by substantial hormonal, metabolic and immunological changes during which gut microbiota is also remarkably remodeled. Dietary fiber has been demonstrated to have a striking role in shifting the microbial composition so as to improve host metabolism and health in non-pregnant individuals. The present study was conducted to investigate effects of adding a soluble dietary fiber inulin (0 or 1.5%) to low- or high- fat (0 or 5% fat addition) gestational diet on maternal and neonatal health and fecal microbial composition in a sow model. Results showed that inulin addition decreased the gestational body weight gain and fat accumulation induced by fat addition. Circulating concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, adipokine leptin and chemerin were decreased by inulin supplementation. Inulin addition remarkably reduced the average BMI of newborn piglets and the within litter BMI distributions (%) ranging between 17 and 20 kg/m2, and increased the BMI distribution ranging between 14 and 17 kg/m2. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region showed that fecal microbial changes at different taxonomic levels triggered by inulin addition predisposed the pregnant sow to be thinner and lower inflammatory. Meanwhile, fecal microbial composition was also profoundly altered by gestation stage with distinct changes occurring at perinatal period. Most representative volatile fatty acid (VFA) producing-related genera changed dramatically when reaching the perinatal period and varied degrees of increases were detected with inulin addition. Fecal VFA concentrations failed to show any significant effect with dietary intervention, however, were markedly increased at perinatal period. Our findings indicate that positive microbial changes resulted by 1.5% soluble fiber inulin addition would possibly be the potential mechanisms under which maternal body weight, metabolic and inflammatory status and neonatal BMI were improved. Besides, distinct changes of microbial community at perinatal period indicated the mother sow is undergoing a catabolic state with increased energy loss and inflammation response at that period compared with other stages of gestation.",20171206,8,,10.3389/fmicb.2017.02242,1664-302X

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is well known to initiate the inflammatory cascade in the central nervous system. However, whether and how DE and DE-SOA exposure influences TLR4 signaling in the immature brain remains unclear. We attempted to evaluate the roles of TLR-4, inflammatory mediators and microglial markers in the impaired spatial learning ability of neonatal mice exposed to DE and DE-SOAs. Pregnant C3H/HeN (TLR4-intact) and C3H/HeJ (TLR4- mutated) mice were exposed to clean air, DE or DE-SOA from gestational day 14 to postnatal day (PND) 10 (5h/day for 5days) in exposure chambers. PND11 neonatal mice were examined for their performance in the olfactory-based spatial learning test. After the spatial learning test, the hippocampi of the mice were removed and real-time RT-PCR analysis was performed to examine the neurological and immunological markers. Both male and female C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ neonatal mice exposed to DE and DE-SOAs showed poor performance in the test phase of spatial learning as compared to the mice exposed to clean air. However, this spatial learning deficit was prominent in C3H/HeJ neonatal mice.

However, the underlying mechanisms which increase pregnant mothers' risk following influenza virus infection have not been fully elucidated. We used pregnant BALB/c mice during mid- to late gestation to determine the impact of a sub-lethal infection with A/Brisbane/59/07 H1N1 seasonal influenza virus on completion of gestation. Maternal and fetal health status was closely monitored and compared to infected non-pregnant mice. Severity of infection during pregnancy was correlated with premature rupture of amniotic membranes (PROM), fetal survival and body weight at birth, lung viral load and degree of systemic and tissue inflammation mediated by innate and adaptive immune responses. Here we report that influenza virus infection resulted in dysregulation of inflammatory responses that led to pre-term labor, impairment of fetal growth, increased fetal mortality and maternal morbidity. We observed significant compartment-specific immune responses correlated with changes in hormonal synthesis and regulation. Dysregulation of progesterone, COX-2, PGE2 and PGF2&#945; expression in infected pregnant mice was accompanied by significant remodeling of placental architecture and upregulation of MMP-9 early after infection.

Indeed, certain stimuli, if applied to a sensible phase of development, are able to modify, through epigenetic mechanisms, gene expression of DNA, resulting in adaptive modifications of phenotype to the environment, which may reflect negatively on the health of every individual. This concept, applied to nutrition, has opened up important prospects for research in this area. The nutritional history of an individual, linked to the development of a healthy state, would begin very early. In fact, since the pregnancy and for the next two years (for a total of about 1000 days), the maternal eating habits, the type of breastfeeding and then the main stages of nutrition in the evolutionary phase represent those sensitive moments, essential for the development of important endocrine, metabolic, immunological alterations, better known as metabolic syndrome. This condition would represent the physiopathogenetic basis for explaining a series of disorders, known as non communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascolar disease and all those conditions that today affect the health of most industrialized countries and through the years are emerging especially in developing countries (South America, Asia), where new environmental conditions and increased food availability are changing food habits, with far-reaching public health impacts.

It has been proposed that developmental programming has long-lasting effects in the offspring that might be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation. Altered stress regulation or impaired immunological function of the mother can potentially affect DNA methylation processes of the fetus, changing gene expression levels in utero. These underlying biological processes can be tested in animal models, where pharmacological experiments using epigenetic drugs can prove causality. Recent human studies show that DNA methylation changes of hypothesis-driven candidate gene regions, such as the promoter of the glucocorticoid receptor and the serotonin transporter, were associated with maternal depression in peripheral tissue samples of newborns' cord blood, infants' saliva, or adults' peripheral blood. In addition, epigenome-wide association studies using blood cells show modest but significant changes in a subset of genes involved in immune functions. These DNA methylation changes were found mainly in enhancers, which point to regulatory effects in gene expression. Limited number of studies using brain tissue showed a significant overlap of differentially methylated genes in the different studies. In conclusion, prenatal maternal depression can induce covalent modifications in the offspring's DNA, which are detectable at birth in leukocytes and could be potentially present in other tissues, consistent with the hypothesis that system-wide epigenetic changes are involved in life-long responses to the psychosocial environment in utero.

Whether basal immune status in vivo is largely unaffected by pregnancy, is constitutively biased towards an inflammatory phenotype (transiently enhancing host defense) or exhibits anti-inflammatory bias (reducing potential responsiveness to the fetus) is unclear. Here, in a longitudinal study of healthy women who gave birth to healthy infants following uncomplicated pregnancies within the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) cohort, we test the hypothesis that a progressively altered bias in resting innate immune status develops. Women were examined during pregnancy and again, one and/or three years postpartum. Most pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, including CCL2, CXCL10, IL-18 and TNF&#945;, was reduced in vivo during pregnancy (20-57%, p<0.0001). Anti-inflammatory biomarkers (sTNF-RI, sTNF-RII, and IL-1Ra) were elevated by ~50-100% (p<0.0001). Systemic IL-10 levels were unaltered during vs. post-pregnancy. Kinetic studies demonstrate that while decreased pro-inflammatory biomarker expression (CCL2, CXCL10, IL-18, and TNF&#945;) was constant, anti-inflammatory expression increased progressively with increasing gestational age (p<0.0001). We conclude that healthy resting maternal immune status is characterized by an increasingly pronounced bias towards a systemic anti-inflammatory innate phenotype during the last two trimesters of pregnancy.

In this review, we summarize the known changes in microbial composition throughout pregnancy at a variety of body sites, including the gut, vagina, oral cavity, and placenta, and we describe several studies that have linked pregnancy complications with microbial changes. Unlike the case of certain disease states, such as obesity, where dysbiosis is considered to have negative effects, we believe that the microbial alterations observed during pregnancy are vital for a healthy pregnancy.

AIMS: To review calls made to MotherSafe about paternal exposures to teratogens during the 16 year period, 2000-2015, and to document any patterns or changes in calls over the period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective descriptive assessment of a prospectively collected database (2000-2015) was undertaken. Telephone counselling records identified the drugs of concern regarding paternal exposures. The information about paternal exposures provided in consumer and production information was also reviewed. RESULTS: Of a total of 253 103 calls received at MotherSafe between 2000 and 2015, 1072 calls (0.4%) were regarding paternal exposures.

As a result, cows transitioning between pregnancy and lactation are at a greater risk of metabolic and infectious diseases. The ability of neutrophils to mount an effective immune response to an infection is critical for its resolution, and increasing evidence indicates that precalving nutrition affects postpartum neutrophil function. The objectives of the current study were to investigate the effect of 2 precalving body condition scores (BCS; 4 vs. 5 on a 10-point scale) and 2 levels of feeding (75 vs. 125% of estimated maintenance requirements) on gene expression in circulating neutrophils. We isolated RNA from the neutrophils of cows (n = 45) at 5 time points over the transition period: precalving (-1 wk), day of calving (d 0), and postcalving at wk 1, 2, and 4. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR with custom-designed primer pairs and Roche Universal Probe Library (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) chemistry, combined with microfluidics integrated fluidic circuit chips (96.96 dynamic array), were used to quantify the expression of 78 genes involved in neutrophil function and 18 endogenous control genes. Statistical significance between time points was determined using repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer multiple-testing correction to determine treatment effects among weeks. Precalving BCS altered the inflammatory state of neutrophils, with significant increases in overall gene expression of antimicrobial peptides (BNBD4 and DEFB10) and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10, and significantly decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL23A in thinner cows (BCS 4) compared with cows calving at BCS 5. Feeding level had a time-dependent effect on gene expression; for example, increased expression of genes involved in leukotriene synthesis (PLA2G4A and ALOX5AP) occurred only at 1 wk postcalving in cows overfed (125% of requirements) precalving compared with those offered 75% of maintenance requirements. Results indicate that precalving body condition and changes in prepartum energy lead to altered gene expression of circulating neutrophils, highlighting the importance of transition cow nutrition for peripartum health.",20170123,100,3,10.3168/jds.2016-12105,1525-3198

We describe the rationale, study design, implementation, and enrollment of the initial group of participants in the MTN seroconverter cohort. METHODS: Initiated in 2008, MTN-015 is an ongoing observational cohort study enrolling participants who acquire HIV-1 infection during effectiveness studies of candidate microbicides. Eligible participants from recently completed and ongoing MTN trials are enrolled after seroconversion and return for regular follow-up visits with clinical and behavioral data collection. Biologic samples including blood and genital fluids are stored for future testing. RESULTS: MTN-015 was implemented initially at six African sites and enrolled 100/139 (72%) of eligible women who seroconverted in HIV Prevention Trials Network protocol 035 (HPTN 035, conducted by the MTN). The median time from seroconversion in HPTN 035 to enrollment in MTN-015 was 18 months. Retention was good with >70% of visits completed. Implementation challenges included regulatory reviews, translation, and testing of questionnaires, and site readiness.

METHODS: We recruited black/African American pregnant women ages 18 to 50 y from Atlanta, GA to participate in a prospective, randomized controlled trial of influenza immunization messaging conducted from January to April 2013. Eligible participants were randomized to 3 study arms. We conducted follow-up questionnaires on influenza immunization at 30-days post-partum with all groups. Chi-square and t tests evaluated group differences, and outcome intention-to-treat assessment utilized log-binomial regression models. RESULTS: Of the 106 enrolled, 95 women completed the study (90% retention), of which 31 were randomly assigned to affective messaging intervention (""Pregnant Pause"" video), 30 to cognitive messaging intervention (""Vaccines for a Healthy Pregnancy"" video), and 34 to a comparison condition (receipt of the Influenza Vaccine Information Statement). The three groups were balanced on baseline demographic characteristics and reported health behaviors. At baseline, most women (63%, n = 60) reported no receipt of seasonal influenza immunization during the previous 5 y. They expressed a low likelihood (2.1 ± 2.8 on 0-10 scale) of obtaining influenza immunization during their current pregnancy. At 30-days postpartum follow-up, influenza immunization was low among all participants (7-13%) demonstrating no effect after a single exposure to either affective messaging (RR = 1.10; 95% CI: 0.30-4.01) or cognitive messaging interventions (RR = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.11-2.88). Women cited various reasons for not obtaining maternal influenza immunizations. These included concern about vaccine harm (47%, n = 40), low perceived influenza infection risk (31%, n = 26), and a history of immunization nonreceipt (24%, n = 20). CONCLUSION: The findings reflect the limitations associated with a single exposure to varying maternal influenza immunization message approaches on vaccine behavior.

In normal pregnancy, the mother experiences mild metabolic syndrome-like condition through week 20 of gestation. A pronounced phenotype of metabolic syndrome may program pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a serious complication with a myriad of manifestations for mother and offspring. This pregnancy syndrome is a polygenic disease and has been now linked to higher incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and several other disorders associated with vulnerable organs. Furthermore, the offspring born to preeclamptic mothers also exhibit an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and mental disorders during adulthood. This suggests that preeclampsia not only exposes the mother and the fetus to complications during pregnancy but also programs chronic diseases in later life. The etiology of preeclampsia is thought to be primarily associated with poor placentation and entails excessive maternal inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. It is well established now that the maternal immune system and the placenta are involved in a highly choreographed cross-talk that underlies adequate spiral artery remodeling required for uteroplacental perfusion and free flow of nutrients to the fetus. Since normal pregnancy is associated with a sequence of events represented by temporal events of inflammation (implantation), anti-inflammation (gestation), and inflammation (parturition), it is quite possible that unscheduled alterations in these regulatory responses may lead to pathologic consequences. Although it is not clear whether immunological alterations occur early in pregnancy, it is proposed that dysregulated systemic and placental immunity contribute to impaired angiogenesis and the onset of preeclampsia. This review will focus on important aspects of the immune system that coordinate with placental dysfunction to program preeclampsia and influence health in later life.",20160625,38,6,,1863-2300

We hypothesized that chronic fetal inflammation may lead to alterations in development of the fetal immune system. To test this hypothesis, we examined neonates with gastroschisis, a congenital abdominal wall defect that leads to exposure of the fetal intestines to amniotic fluid, with resultant intestinal inflammation. We determined that patients with gastroschisis show high systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as eotaxin, as well as earlier activation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) effector and memory T cells in the cord blood compared with controls. Additionally, increased numbers of T cells and eosinophils infiltrate the serosa and mucosa of the inflamed intestines. Using a mouse model of gastroschisis, we observed higher numbers of eosinophils and both type 2 and type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2 and ILC3), specifically in the portion of organs exposed to the amniotic fluid. Given the role of IL-5 produced by ILC2 in regulating eosinophil development and survival, we determined that maternal or fetal administration of the anti-IL-5 neutralizing Ab, or a depleting Ab against ILCs, can both effectively reduce intestinal eosinophilia. Thus, a congenital anomaly causing chronic inflammation can alter the composition of circulating and tissue-resident fetal immune cells. Given the high rate of prenatal and neonatal complications in these patients, such changes have clinical significance and might become targets for fetal therapy.",20160517,196,12,10.4049/jimmunol.1502587,1550-6606

During fetal and perinatal development, the small intestine is affected by the maternal environment and nutrient intake. In ruminants, altered small-intestinal mass, villi morphology, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, vascularity, and gene expression have been observed as a result of poor gestational nutrition or intrauterine growth restriction. Although many of these data come from fetal stages, data have also demonstrated that nutrition during mid- and late gestation affects lamb small-intestinal growth, vascularity, digestive enzyme activity, and gene expression at 20 and 180 d of age as well. The small intestine is known to be a highly plastic tissue, changing with nutrient intake and physiological state even in adulthood, and the maternal small intestine adapts to pregnancy and advancing gestation. In ruminants, the growth, vascularity, and gene expression of the maternal small intestine also adapt to the nutritional plane and specific nutrient intake such as high selenium during pregnancy. These changes likely alter both pre- and postnatal nutrient delivery to offspring. More research is necessary to better understand the role of the offspring and maternal small intestines in whole-animal responses to developmental programming, but programming of this plastic tissue seems to play a dynamic role in gestational nutrition impacts on the whole animal.",20160517,7,1,,2156-5376

Treatment of trichomoniasis is therefore essential for improving sexual and reproductive health outcomes. A timely, sensitive diagnostic test for T vaginalis may increase the accuracy of clinician's treatment decisions, resulting in more infected women receiving treatment and fewer uninfected women receiving treatment. METHODS: This study was a retrospective observational assessment of electronic medical records before and after point-of-care (POC) implementation of the rapid antigen test. Records were collected from women aged 14 to 20 years who received a T vaginalis test in the emergency department during either study period. The main outcome measures were rates of accurate treatment, inaccurate treatment, and missed treatment of trichomoniasis in each study period. RESULTS: Overall rates of accurate treatment increased from 78.7% pre-POC to 87.7% post-POC (P = .02). Specifically, rates of not treating uninfected women increased from 61.4% pre-POC to 70.4% post-POC (P = .06), and rates of treating infected women were the same pre-POC (17.3%) and post-POC (17.3%; P = .99). Rates of inaccurate treatment decreased from 23.1% pre-POC to 13.1% post-POC (P = .02). Changes in missed treatment rates (14.0% pre-POC; 8.8% post-POC; P = .73) were not statistically significant.

Responses to stress are often classified as behavioral, immunological, neuroendocrine, and autonomic. In production systems, understanding all facets of stress response is important to correctly predict the consequences of stressors to the health and performance of animals and to prevent costly managerial changes that have minimal effect on animal well-being and performance. Common social stressors faced by periparturient animals are regrouping, overstocking, and for nulliparous animals, commingling with parous animals. In conventional dairies, feeding strategies during the periparturient period often require several group changes during the most challenging period of an animal's life. Traditional weekly regrouping of prepartum cows increases competitive behavior at the feed bunk but it does not affect immune and metabolic responses, health and production, as long as stocking density is not overwhelming, and nulliparous and parous animals are housed separately. Stocking density of prepartum animals may be overlooked because these are nonproductive animals. Severe overstocking (200% of feeding space) of commingled nulliparous and parous pregnant animals produces neuroendocrine and metabolic changes. On the other hand, when prepartum nulliparous and parous animals are housed separately, stocking densities of up to 120% do not seem to affect innate and adaptive immunity, metabolic responses, milk yield, and reproductive performance, despite increasing negative behavior among cows. In recent experiments, when animals were ranked based on feed bunk displacement, dominant animals were more likely to be diagnosed with metritis than subordinate animals. Importantly, dominant animals with large number of interactions with pen mates (displacement at the feed bunk) were considerably more likely to be diagnosed with uterine diseases (retained placenta and metritis) and to be removed from the herd within 60d postpartum. Much has been learned about behavioral responses of cows to stressful conditions, but our understanding of neuroendocrine and immune responses to such conditions is somewhat limited. A multidisciplinary approach to research that encompasses several responses to stress and biological functions is critical.",20160223,99,4,10.3168/jds.2015-10369,1525-3198

A major contributing factor to increased health disorders is alterations in bovine immune mechanisms. Indeed, uncontrolled inflammation is a major contributing factor and a common link among several economically important infectious and metabolic diseases including mastitis, retained placenta, metritis, displaced abomasum, and ketosis. The nutritional status of dairy cows and the metabolism of specific nutrients are critical regulators of immune cell function. There is now a greater appreciation that certain mediators of the immune system can have a reciprocal effect on the metabolism of nutrients. Thus, any disturbances in nutritional or immunological homeostasis can provide deleterious feedback loops that can further enhance health disorders, increase production losses, and decrease the availability of safe and nutritious dairy foods for a growing global population. This review will discuss the complex interactions between nutrient metabolism and immune functions in periparturient dairy cattle. Details of how either deficiencies or overexposure to macro- and micronutrients can contribute to immune dysfunction and the subsequent development of health disorders will be presented. Specifically, the ways in which altered nutrient metabolism and oxidative stress can interact to compromise the immune system in transition cows will be discussed.

Studies have linked this scar formation to the inflammatory phase of wound healing. Instructive biomaterials designed for tendon regeneration are often designed to provide both structural and cellular support. In order to facilitate regeneration, success may be found by tempering the body's inflammatory response. This work combines collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffolds, previously developed for tissue regeneration, with matrix materials (hyaluronic acid and amniotic membrane) that have been shown to promote healing and decreased scar formation in skin studies. The results presented show that scaffolds containing amniotic membrane matrix have significantly increased mechanical properties and that tendon cells within these scaffolds have increased metabolic activity even when the media is supplemented with the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 beta. Collagen scaffolds containing hyaluronic acid or amniotic membrane also temper the expression of genes associated with the inflammatory response in normal tendon healing (TNF-&#945;, COLI, MMP-3). These results suggest that alterations to scaffold composition, to include matrix known to decrease scar formation in vivo, can modify the inflammatory response in tenocytes. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This required the acquisition of highly regulated and coordinated immunological mechanisms. Failures in the development of these strategies not only lead to the interruption of pregnancy but also compromise maternal health. Alongside changes on the cytokine profile - expansion of tolerogenic dendritic and regulatory T cells - a profound adaptation of the B cell compartment during pregnancy was recently described. Among others, the suppression of B cell lymphopoiesis and B cell lymphopenia were proposed to be protective mechanisms tending to reduce the occurrence of autoreactive B cells that might recognize fetal structures and put pregnancy on risk. On the other hand, expansion of the pre-activated marginal zone (MZ) B cell phenotype was described as a compensatory strategy launched to overcome B cell lymphopenia thus ensuring a proper defense. In this work, using an animal model of pregnancy disturbances, we demonstrated that the suppression of B cell lymphopoiesis as well as splenic B cell lymphopenia occur independently of pregnancy outcome. However, only animals undergoing normal pregnancies, but not those suffering from pregnancy disturbances, could induce an expansion and activation of the MZ B cells. Hence, our results clearly show that MZ B cells, probably due to the production of natural protective antibodies, participate in the fine balance of immune activation required for pregnancy well-being.",20151024,151,1,10.1530/REP-15-0274,1741-7899

Using applicable monitoring indicators for tracking progress in the UN/WHO framework on continuum of maternal, newborn, and child health care, this study evaluated the progress of Sokoto toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5 by December 2015. The changes in outcomes in 2012-2013 associated with maternal and child health interventions were assessed. DESIGN: We used baseline and follow-up lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) data obtained in 2012 and 2013, respectively. In each of the surveys, data were obtained from 437 households sampled from 19 LQAS locations in each of the 23 local government areas (LGAs). The composite state-level coverage estimates of the respective indicators were aggregated from estimated LGA coverage estimates. RESULTS: None of the nine indicators associated with the continuum of maternal, neonatal, and child care satisfied the recommended 90% coverage target for achieving MDGs 4 and 5. Similarly, the average state coverage estimates were lower than national coverage estimates. Marginal improvements in coverage were obtained in the demand for family planning satisfied, antenatal care visits, postnatal care for mothers, and exclusive breast-feeding. Antibiotic treatment for acute pneumonia increased significantly by 12.8 percentage points. The majority of the LGAs were classifiable as low-performing, high-priority areas for intensified program intervention.

To understand this mixed progress and to identify priorities for the post-2015 era, Tanzania was selected as a Countdown to 2015 case study. METHODS: We analysed progress made in Tanzania between 1990 and 2014 in maternal, newborn, and child mortality, and unmet need for family planning, in which we used a health systems evaluation framework to assess coverage and equity of interventions along the continuum of care, health systems, policies and investments, while also considering contextual change (eg, economic and educational). We had five objectives, which assessed each level of the health systems evaluation framework. We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) and did multiple linear regression analyses to explain the reduction in child mortality in Tanzania. We analysed the reasons for the slower changes in maternal and newborn survival and family planning, to inform priorities to end preventable maternal, newborn, and child deaths by 2030. FINDINGS: In the past two decades, Tanzania's population has doubled in size, necessitating a doubling of health and social services to maintain coverage. Total health-care financing also doubled, with donor funding for child health and HIV/AIDS more than tripling. Trends along the continuum of care varied, with preventive child health services reaching high coverage (&#8805;85%) and equity (socioeconomic status difference 13-14%), but lower coverage and wider inequities for child curative services (71% coverage, socioeconomic status difference 36%), facility delivery (52% coverage, socioeconomic status difference 56%), and family planning (46% coverage, socioeconomic status difference 22%). The LiST analysis suggested that around 39% of child mortality reduction was linked to increases in coverage of interventions, especially of immunisation and insecticide-treated bednets. Economic growth was also associated with reductions in child mortality. Child health programmes focused on selected high-impact interventions at lower levels of the health system (eg, the community and dispensary levels). Despite its high priority, implementation of maternal health care has been intermittent. Newborn survival has gained attention only since 2005, but high-impact interventions are already being implemented. Family planning had consistent policies but only recent reinvestment in implementation. INTERPRETATION: Mixed progress in reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health in Tanzania indicates a complex interplay of political prioritisation, health financing, and consistent implementation. Post-2015 priorities for Tanzania should focus on the unmet need for family planning, especially in the Western and Lake regions; addressing gaps for coverage and quality of care at birth, especially in rural areas; and continuation of progress for child health.

In recent years, epidemiological and experimental evidence has accumulated to suggest that prenatal exposure to immune challenges can also negatively affect various physiological and metabolic functions beyond those typically associated with primary defects in CNS development. These peripheral changes include excessive accumulation of adipose tissue and increased body weight, impaired glycemic regulation and insulin resistance, altered myeloid lineage development, increased gut permeability, hyperpurinergia, and changes in microbiota composition. Experimental work in animal models further suggests that at least some of these peripheral abnormalities could directly contribute to CNS dysfunctions, so that normalization of peripheral pathologies could lead to an amelioration of behavioral deficits. Hence, seemingly unrelated central and peripheral effects of prenatal infection could represent interrelated pathological entities that emerge in response to a common developmental stressor. Targeting peripheral abnormalities may thus represent a valuable strategy to improve the wide spectrum of behavioral abnormalities that can emerge in subjects with prenatal infection histories.",20150501,309,1,10.1152/ajpregu.00087.2015,1522-1490

In addition to reviewing evidence for immunological factors in schizophrenia, this paper discusses how an emerging model of atypical immune function and development helps explain a wide variety of well-established - but puzzling - findings about schizophrenia. A number of theorists have presented hypotheses that early immune system programming, disrupted by pre- and perinatal adversity, often combines with abnormal brain development to produce schizophrenia. The present paper focuses on the hypothesis that disruption of early immune system development produces a latent immune vulnerability that manifests more fully after puberty, when changes in immune function and the thymus leave individuals more susceptible to infections and immune dysfunctions that contribute to schizophrenia. Complementing neurodevelopmental models, this hypothesis integrates findings on many contributing factors to schizophrenia, including prenatal adversity, genes, climate, migration, infections, and stress, among others. It helps explain, for example, why (a) schizophrenia onset is typically delayed until years after prenatal adversity, (b) individual risk factors alone often do not lead to schizophrenia, and (c) schizophrenia prevalence rates actually tend to be higher in economically advantaged countries. Here we discuss how the hypothesis explains 10 key findings, and suggests new, potentially highly cost-effective, strategies for treatment and prevention of schizophrenia. Moreover, while most human research linking immune factors to schizophrenia has been correlational, these strategies provide ethical ways to experimentally test in humans theories about immune function and schizophrenia.

To that end, pregnant C57BL/6 mice who were exposed to DES and miR profiles in thymocytes of both the mother and fetuses on postnatal day 3 (gestation day 17) were studied. Of the 609 mouse miRs examined, we noted 59 altered miRs that were common for both mothers and fetuses, whereas 107 altered miRs were specific to mothers only and 101 altered miRs were specific to fetuses only. Upon further analyses in the fetuses, we observed that DES-mediated changes in miR expression may regulate genes involved in important functions, such as apoptosis, autophagy, toxicity, and cancer. Of the miRs that showed decreased expression following DES treatment, miR-18b and miR-23a were found to possess complementary sequences and binding affinity for 3' untranslated regions of the Fas ligand (FasL) and Fas, respectively. Transfection studies confirmed that DES-mediated downregulation of miR-18b and miR-23a led to increased FasL and Fas expression.

During pregnancy, the maternal immune system changes to enable placental development and growth and acceptance of the semi-allogeneic fetus. As an adjuvant is a pro-inflammatory substance, it may interfere with these immunological changes, resulting in poor placentation or placental growth, which may result in preeclampsia (PE) and fetal intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). This study investigated a possible association between adjuvanted H1N1/09 vaccination and the development of PE and/or IUGR. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. Cases were Dutch women with PE and/or IUGR occurring during H1N1/09 vaccination program. Controls had uncomplicated pregnancies during the same period. Maternal characteristics, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were collected from medical files. Participants were contacted by telephone to enquire about vaccination. Data were analyzed using t-tests, Chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests. Multivariate analysis was conducted to control for confounders. RESULTS: We included 254 cases and 247 controls. Of the cases, 90 (35.4%) were vaccinated, compared to 87 (35.2%) of the controls (OR:1.009, 95% CI:0.70-1.46, p:0.961). The majority (73.5%) had been vaccinated in second and third trimester.

This study sought to characterize T-cell populations after birth in HEU infants and unexposed infants living in a semirural area in southern Mozambique. METHODS: Between August 2008 and June 2009 mother-infant pairs were enrolled at the Manhiça District Hospital at delivery into a prospective observational analysis of immunological and health outcomes in HEU infants. Infants were invited to return at one month of age for a clinical examination, HIV DNA-PCR, and immunophenotypic analyses. The primary analysis sought to assess immunological differences between HEU and unexposed groups, whereas the secondary analysis assessed the impact of maternal HIV RNA viral load in the HEU group. Infants who had a positive HIV DNA-PCR test were not included in the analysis. RESULTS: At one month of age, the 74 HEU and the 56 unexposed infants had similar median levels of naïve, memory and activated CD8 and CD4 T-cells. Infant naïve and activated CD8 T-cells were found to be associated with maternal HIV-RNA load at delivery. HEU infants born to women with HIV-RNA loads above 5 log10 copies/mL had lower median levels of naïve CD8 T-cells (p = 0.04), and higher median levels of memory CD8 T-cells, (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that exposure to elevated maternal HIV-RNA puts the infant at higher risk of having early T-cell abnormalities. Improving prophylaxis of mother to child HIV programs such that more women have undetectable viral load is crucial to decrease vertical transmission of HIV, but may also be important to reduce the consequences of HIV virus exposure in HEU infants.",20150204,15,,10.1186/s12879-015-0766-6,1471-2334

This study aimed to analyze the long-term outcomes and risk factors in immunized infants with hepatitis B. METHODS: The clinical parameters and outcomes of 41 infants born after universal immunization, and admitted for HBV-positive hepatitis were studied. All patients were followed for at least 6 months (median â= 4.4 years, range 0.6-18.1 years). Patient survival, changes of HBsAg and HBeAg status, and complications were analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 41 cases (32 males, 9 females), 21 presented with fulminant hepatitis (FH), and 20 with non-fulminant hepatitis (NFH). Ninety-five percent (36/38) of the mothers were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Multivariate analyses revealed younger age of onset (age <7 months) and negative maternal hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) were associated with FH (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). An infantile fulminant hepatitis B risk score using maternal/infant HBeAg positivity and onset age was proposed. Among the FH cases, the rate of mortality, HBsAg clearance, and chronic HBV infection were 47.6%, 38.1%, and 14.3%, respectively. Among the NFH cases, 35% developed chronic infection. Of the 9 chronically infected children received long-term follow-up, 8 had HBeAg seroconversion before 4 years of age. One case of FH developed hepatocellular carcinoma 14 years later. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal HBsAg + /HBeAg- and early onset age were risk factors for FH in immunized infants. A significant portion of patients with FH or NFH evolve to chronic HBV infection, with HBeAg seroconversion in young childhood.

In preconception, anti-DNA, hypocomplementemia, previous thrombosis, triple antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody positivity, active lupus nephritis and discontinuation of medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine are factors associated with pregnancy failure. During pregnancy, SLE flares are associated with aPL antibodies, synergic changes of pregnancy on Th1 and TH2 cytokines, other cytokines and chemokines that interact with hormones such as estrogen and prolactin that amplify the inflammatory effect. From the clinical point of view, SLE activity at pregnancy onset, thrombocytopenia, lupus nephritis, arterial hypertension, aPL syndromes, preeclampsia is associated with lupus flares and fetal complications. In puerperium, the risk factors of flares are similar to pregnancy. Hyperactivity of immune system, autoantibodies, hyperprolactinemia, active lupus nephritis, decrease in TH2 cytokines with increase in TH1 cytokines probably participate in SLE flare. The SLE flares during pregnancy make the difference between an uncomplicated pregnancy and pregnancy with maternal and fetal complications.

METHODS: Combination antiretroviral regimens were offered to pregnant and breastfeeding, HIV-infected women, irrespective of immunological status, at four rural health facilities. Twenty-four-month HIV-free survival among children born to HIV-infected mothers was determined before and after PMTCT programme implementation using community surveys. Households were randomly selected and women who had given birth in the previous 24 months were asked to participate. Mothers were tested for HIV antibodies and children born to HIV-infected mothers were tested for viral deoxyribonucleic acid. Multivariable models were used to determine factors associated with child HIV infection or death. FINDINGS: In the first survey (2008-2009), 335 of 1778 women (18.8%) tested positive for HIV. In the second (2011), 390 of 2386 (16.3%) tested positive. The 24-month HIV-free survival in HIV-exposed children was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.63-0.76) in the first survey and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.83-0.94) in the second. Combination antiretroviral regimen use was associated with a lower risk of HIV infection or death in children (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.33, 95% CI: 0.15-0.73). Maternal knowledge of HIV status, use of HIV tests and use of combination regimens during pregnancy increased between the surveys. CONCLUSION: The PMTCT programme was associated with an increased HIV-free survival in children born to HIV-infected mothers.

Leptin (LEP), a metabolic hormone, has also been implicated in the promotion of angiogenesis. In this study, LEP and its long form receptor (OB-Rb) were evaluated during porcine pregnancy to assess their basal level of expression and their potential role in conceptus development. METHODS: Expression and secretion of LEP and OB-Rb were quantified in the endometrium of non-pregnant (n = 5), and in the endometrium and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of pregnant sows (parity 2 to 5) at gestational days (gd) 20 (n = 8) and 50 (n = 8). Data were analyzed by a 3-way ANOVA testing the effects of conceptus health, tissue type and gestational day. RESULTS: Leptin and OB-Rb transcripts were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in pregnant than in non-pregnant sows. Significantly greater LEP (P < 0.001) was detected in the endometrial tissue at gd20 compared with gd50. At the protein level, the lowest LEP expression (P < 0.01) was detected in the CAM at gd50, while OB-Rb protein was significantly lower (P < 0.01) at gd50 in the CAM than in the endometrium collected from gd20 and gd50 conceptus attachment sites. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the expression of these proteins at both gestational days and in both tissue types. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the expression patterns of LEP and OB-Rb between gd20 and gd50 suggest a role for the LEP/OB-R complex at the early stages of porcine pregnancy, possibly affecting the attachment process. Further mechanistic studies are warranted to understand the specific role of leptin in porcine pregnancy.",20140924,12,,10.1186/1477-7827-12-91,1477-7827

Immunization of pregnant women against influenza is currently recommended in many countries and has been proven to be safe and effective in reducing rates and severity of the disease in vaccinated mothers and their children. Influenza vaccination is also cost-effective. Nevertheless, influenza vaccine coverage remains low in pregnant women. This might stem from the lack of healthcare workers' education, a feeling among the general public that influenza is not a serious disease and a failure of prenatal care providers to offer the vaccine.

Within the pregnant decidualizing uterus, coordinated vascular, immunological and stromal cell changes occur. Considerable attention has been given to the roles of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells in initiating decidual spiral arterial remodeling, a process normally completed by mid-gestation in mice and in humans. However, leukocyte roles in much earlier, region specific, decidual vascular remodeling are now being defined. Interest in immune cell-promoted vascular remodeling is driven by vascular aberrations that are reported in human gestational complications such as infertility, recurrent spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction. Appropriate maternal cardiovascular responses during pregnancy protect mothers and their children from later cardiovascular disease risk elevation. One of the earliest uterine responses to pregnancy in species with hemochorial placentation is stromal cell decidualization, which creates unique niches for angiogenesis and leukocyte recruitment. In early decidua basalis, the aspect of the implantation site that will cradle the developing placenta and provide the major blood vessels to support mature placental functions, leukocytes are greatly enriched and display specialized properties. UNK cells, the most abundant leukocyte subset in early decidua basalis, have angiogenic abilities and are essential for normal early decidual angiogenesis.

Well-conducted systematic reviews have the ability to make robust, generalizable conclusions, with good meta-analyses potentially providing the closest estimate of the true effect size. In this paper, we undertake a systematic approach to synthesising the available evidence from well-conducted systematic reviews on schizophrenia. METHOD: Reviews were identified by searching Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Current Contents and PsycINFO. The decision to include or exclude reviews, data extraction and quality assessments were conducted in duplicate. Evidence was graded as high quality if reviews contained large samples and robust results; and as moderate quality if reviews contained imprecision, inconsistency, smaller samples or study designs that may be prone to bias. RESULTS: High- and moderate-quality evidence shows that numerous psychosocial and biomedical treatments are effective. Patients have relatively poor cognitive functioning, and subtle, but diverse, structural brain alterations, altered electrophysiological functioning and sleep patterns, minor physical anomalies, neurological soft signs, and sensory alterations. There are markers of infection, inflammation or altered immunological parameters; and there is increased mortality from a range of causes. Risk for schizophrenia is increased with cannabis use, pregnancy and birth complications, prenatal exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, childhood central nervous system viral infections, childhood adversities, urbanicity and immigration (first and second generation), particularly in certain ethnic groups.

There is currently no empirical data on the effectiveness of Malawian PMTCT programs. This study describes a surveillance approach to obtain population-based estimates of the VTR of infants <3 months of age in Malawi immediately after the adoption of Option B+. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A sample of caregivers and infants <3 months from 53 randomly chosen immunization clinics in 4 districts were enrolled. Infant dried blood spot (DBS) samples were tested for HIV exposure with an antibody test to determine maternal seropositivity. Positive samples were further tested using DNA PCR to determine infant infection status and VTR. Caregivers were surveyed about maternal receipt of PMTCT services. Of the 5,068 DBS samples, 764 were ELISA positive indicating 15.1% (14.1-16.1%) of mothers were HIV-infected and passed antibodies to their infant. Sixty-five of the ELISA-positive samples tested positive by DNA PCR, indicating a vertical transmission rate of 8.5% (6.6-10.7%). Survey data indicates 64.8% of HIV-infected mothers and 46.9% of HIV-exposed infants received some form of antiretroviral prophylaxis. Results do not include the entire breastfeeding period which extends to almost 2 years in Malawi. CONCLUSIONS: The observed VTR was lower than expected given earlier modeled estimates, suggesting that Malawi's PMTCT program has been successful at averting perinatal HIV transmission. Challenges to full implementation of PMTCT remain, particularly around low reported antiretroviral prophylaxis. This approach is a useful surveillance tool to assess changes in PMTCT effectiveness as Option B+ is scaled-up, and can be expanded to track programming effectiveness for young infants over time in Malawi and elsewhere.",20140627,9,6,10.1371/journal.pone.0100741,1932-6203

In particular, this Gram-negative bacterium seems to be associated with hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. During the last decade, the relationship among H. pylori and several extra-gastric diseases strongly emerged in literature. The correlation among H. pylori infection and pregnancy-related disorders was mainly focused on iron deficiency anemia, thrombocytopenia, fetal malformations, miscarriage, pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction. H. pylori infection may have a role in the pathogenesis of various pregnancy-related disorders through different mechanisms: depletion of micronutrients (iron and vitamin B12) in maternal anemia and fetal neural tube defects; local or systemic induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines release and oxidative stress in gastrointestinal disorders and pre-eclampsia; cross-reaction between specific anti-H. pylori antibodies and antigens localized in placental tissue and endothelial cells (pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction, miscarriage). Since H. pylori infection is most likely acquired before pregnancy, it is widely believed that hormonal and immunological changes occurring during pregnancy could activate latent H. pylori with a negative impact not only on maternal health (nutritional deficiency, organ injury, death), but also on the fetus (insufficient growth, malformation, death) and sometime consequences can be observed later in life. Another important issue addressed by investigators was to determine whether it is possible to transmit H. pylori infection from mother to child and whether maternal anti-H. pylori antibodies could prevent infant's infection. Studies on novel diagnostic and therapeutic methods for H. pylori are no less important, since these are particularly sensitive topics in pregnancy conditions. It could be interesting to study the possible correlation between H. pylori infection and other pregnancy-related diseases of unknown etiology, such as gestational diabetes mellitus, obstetric cholestasis and spontaneous preterm delivery. Since H. pylori infection is treatable, the demonstration of its causative role in pregnancy-related disorders will have important social-economic implications.",20140228,20,3,10.3748/wjg.v20.i3.654,2219-2840

We evaluated the impact of self-rated pre-pregnancy health and pregnancy course, hyperemesis, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia on risk of IBD. METHODS: Information was collected by questionnaires from The Danish National Birth Cohort (enrolment 1996-2002) at 16(th) and 30(th) week of pregnancy and 6 months postpartum. A total of 55,699 women were followed from childbirth until development of IBD (using validated National Hospital Discharge Register diagnoses), emigration, death, or end of follow-up, 31(st) of October, 2011. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for age and evaluating pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, alcohol and tobacco consumption, and socio-occupational status as potential confounders. RESULTS: Risk of IBD increased with decreasing level of self-rated pre-pregnancy health (p = 0.002) and was elevated in women with poor self-rated pregnancy course (HR, 1.61, 95% CI 1.22-2.12).

Use of these agents may increase risk of serious infections, malignancies, and other complications such as worsening symptoms of heart failure or demyelinating disease. Because of these risks, a baseline assessment and routine monitoring have been recommended, but standardized guidelines for monitoring have yet to be established. OBJECTIVE: To measure the compliance with the recommended safety monitoring in the Clinical Care Guidelines for BRMs at the University of Illinois Hospitals and Health Sciences System (UI Health). METHODS: The Clinical Care Guidelines for BRMs was developed by a committee of pharmacists, nurses, and physicians based on an assessment of published literature and medication labeling. The guidelines included recommendations for safety monitoring prior to BRM therapy, such as the tuberculosis (TB) test, Hepatitis B surface Antigen (HBsAg) test, liver function test (LFT), complete blood count (CBC), up-to-date vaccinations, risk assessment for cancer, pregnancy testing, monitoring for contraindications with concomitant medications, concomitant disease state risk assessment, and patient education. The guidelines were introduced to UI Health in February 2012 by a systemwide email and by in-services given by the health system's Specialty Pharmacy Service. In-services were given in the clinics known to generate large numbers of BRM orders (e.g., gastroenterology and rheumatology) and at the outpatient center for infused therapies. The purpose of the in-services was to introduce providers to the guidelines and encourage their compliance. To ensure that guideline requirements were met when BRMs were ordered, a process was established to identify BRM orders, assess the orders for compliance with 4 of the safety monitoring tests from the guidelines (TB, HBsAg, LFT, and CBC), and make interventions. When necessary, Specialty Pharmacy Services coordinated with the pharmacists and other providers in the clinic to order lab tests and ensure they were completed prior to the start of therapy. Feedback was provided during the study to proactively improve compliance with the guidelines. After completion of the study, a report containing outpatient prescription orders for BRMs (abatacept, adalimumab, certolizumab, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab, and tocilizumab) from August 2011 through July 2012 was generated from the electronic medical record. Retrospective analyses of completion of safety monitoring were conducted for patients administered BRM treatment. Completion rates were compared before and after implementation of guidelines in February 2012. Completion was considered to have occurred when all 4 safety monitoring tests had been conducted -TB (unless known to be positive from a previous test), HBsAg, LFT, and CBC. Completion data from August 2011 through January 2012 were before the guidelines were implemented, and data from February 2012 through July 2012 were after the guidelines. Chi square analyses were performed on completion frequencies in the patients before and after the guidelines were implemented. RESULTS: Of the 320 unique patient BRM orders evaluated in this study, 195 (61%) were generated in the Rheumatology clinic, 99 (31%) in the Gastroenterology clinic, 21 (6.5%) in the Dermatology clinic, and 5 (1.5%) in the Transplant clinic. Before the guidelines were implemented, 54 ( 31%) of 173 patient orders complied with the safety monitoring by having all 4 clinical tests performed at the appropriate time points. After guideline implementation, 88 (60%) of 147 patient orders were compliant and had all 4 clinical tests conducted, which represents a statistically significant improvement in the rate of compliance (Pearson chi square = 26.43, degrees of freedom (df) = 1, P  less than  0.0001). This significant improvement in compliance rates after guideline implementation was observed in both the new patient group and the patients with continuing prescription orders/treatment changes. There was also an improvement in patients whose prescriptions were dispensed by UI Health and to a lesser degree those whose prescriptions were dispensed by an outside pharmacy. When the new patient group was analyzed separately (n = 92), 50 patients were treated before the guidelines were implemented, and 42 patients were treated after the guidelines were implemented. Compliance rates with safety monitoring in these 2 groups were 52% pre-implementation and 83% post-implementation, which represented a statistically significant improvement in compliance (Pearson chi square = 10.03, df=1, P = 0.0015). Similar results were observed in the second patient subgroup with continuing prescription orders/treatment change (n = 228). A total of 123 patients were treated before the guidelines were implemented, and 105 were treated after the guidelines were implemented. Compliance rates were 23% pre-implementation compared with 50% post-implementation, which represented a statistically significant improvement in compliance (Pearson chi square = 18.99, df = 1, P  less than  0.0001). CONCLUSION: Given the widespread and long-term use of BRMs, safety monitoring and management should be an important part of a comprehensive medication management program for their use. A coordinated effort may have a significant impact on compliance with safety monitoring guidelines.",20130207,19,1,,1944-706X

Most periparturient cows experience bacterial contamination of the uterus after parturition, but only a fraction of these develop subclinical or clinical disease. It is not well understood why one female resolves uterine infections after parturition while another develops disease. Perhaps those that develop metritis or endometritis are exposed to a greater bacterial load at parturition than those that successfully restore the uterus to a healthy condition. A second possibility is that females that develop bacterial disease have compromised immune function, either systemically or in the reproductive tract and associated lymph nodes. Here, the possibility is raised that maternal immunological adjustments to the presence of the allogeneic conceptus may predispose some females to metritis or endometritis. Several regulatory processes ensure that adaptive immune responses against paternal antigens on the conceptus are downregulated during pregnancy. Among these are immunosuppressive effects of progesterone, local accumulation of immune cells that can inhibit inflammation and T cell responses, including M2 macrophages and Î³Î´ T cells, and differentiation of regulatory T cells to inhibit alloreactive lymphocytes. Some immunological adjustments to the conceptus also make the uterus more susceptible to bacterial infection. For example, progesterone not only depresses skin graft rejection but also reduces uterine capacity to eliminate bacterial infections. Macrophages of M2 phenotype can inhibit inflammation and facilitate persistence of some microbial infections. At parturition, immune defenses in the uterus may be further weakened by loss of the luminal epithelium of the endometrium, which is part of the innate immune system, as well as by disappearance of intraepithelial Î³Î´ T cells that produce the antibacterial proteins granulysin and perforin. It is currently not known whether molecules and cells that inhibit immune responses during pregnancy persist after parturition but, if so, they could contribute to compromised immune function in the uterus. It is hypothesized that individual variation in immune adjustments to pregnancy and parturition and the reversal of these changes in the postpartum period are important determinants of susceptibility of the uterus to infection.",20130112,91,4,10.2527/jas.2012-5934,1525-3163

Here we report concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) in a large cross-sectional sample of healthy Filipino women who vary in parity, gestational, and lactational status, and who come from a population previously described as having low CRP. METHODS: Fasting plasma CRP was measured among female participants (ages 20.8-22.4 years) in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (n = 822). RESULTS: Median CRP was 0.2 mg/l in nulliparous women and peaked at 2.0 mg/l in women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Parous but post-partum women had higher CRP compared to nulliparous women, which was largely explained by body composition differences as reflected in waist circumference and skinfold measures. Among post-partum women with infants, CRP was similar in women who were currently breastfeeding compared to those who were not. CONCLUSIONS: At Cebu, women late in gestation have 10-fold higher C-reactive protein compared to nulliparous women, with no evidence that lactation is inflammatory. These population-based findings are similar with findings from prior clinic-based studies and are consistent with the maternal immunological adaptations initiated during pregnancy. The tendency of human females to spend more time than females of other great apes in gestation rather than lactation suggests that the human life history strategy involved increased time spent by reproductively aged females in a pro-inflammatory state.",20121128,25,1,10.1002/ajhb.22351,1520-6300

All participants completed questionnaires detailing their reproductive history. RESULTS: Patients with RA (n = 168) and controls (n = 400) were similar overall in age, education, shared epitope frequency, number of pregnancies, age at first pregnancy, smoking, and breastfeeding history. In multivariate analysis, for women who had &#8805; 6 births the OR for developing RA was 0.43 (95% CI 0.21-0.87) compared with women who had 1-2 births (p = 0.046); for women who gave birth for the first time after age 20 the OR for developing RA was 0.33 (95% CI 0.16-0.66) compared with women whose first birth occurred at age &#8804; 17 (p = 0.001).

Mounting evidence from a number of disciplines suggests a link between immune function and ASD. Although the causes of ASD have yet to be identified, genetic studies have uncovered a host of candidate genes relating to immune regulation that are altered in ASD, while epidemiological studies have shown a relationship with maternal immune disturbances during pregnancy and ASD. Moreover, decades of research have identified numerous systemic and cellular immune abnormalities in individuals with ASD and their families. These include changes in immune cell number, differences in cytokine and chemokine production, and alterations of cellular function at rest and in response to immunological challenge. Many of these changes in immune responses are associated with increasing impairment in behaviors that are core features of ASD. Despite this evidence, much remains to be understood about the precise mechanism by which the immune system alters neurodevelopment and to what extent it is involved in the pathogenesis of ASD. With estimates of ASD as high as 1% of children, ASD is a major public health issue. Improvements in our understanding of the interactions between the nervous and immune system during early neurodevelopment and how this interaction is different in ASD will have important therapeutic implications with wide ranging benefits.",20120831,934,,10.1007/978-1-62703-071-7_12,1940-6029

Dr. Antczak is the Dorothy Havemeyer McConville Professor of Equine Medicine at the Baker Institute for Animal Health in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University. His research focuses on immunological and genetic aspects of the fetal-maternal relationship in the horse. This includes studies of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes and molecules, the regulation of their expression in the placenta, the composition and function of uterine lymphocytes, and alterations in maternal immune reactivity during pregnancy. For this research Dr. Antczak developed a herd of purpose-bred horses selected for homozygosity at the MHC. These horses are a unique genetic resource in equine immunology. During his career Dr. Antczak has mentored over 20 graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, many of whom have gone on to independent careers in immunology research. Dr. Antczak has made contributions to equine immunology, genetics, and reproduction, and collaborated widely with scientists in each of these disciplines. Through his relationship with the Havemeyer Foundation, Dr. Antczak has been a catalyst for cooperative research through a series of Havemeyer Foundation Workshops initiated over 25 years ago. Since 1995 he has been a principal participant in the international Horse Genome Project collaboration furthering his equine immunology research through genomic applications. In 2009 Dr. Antczak was inducted into the University of Kentucky's Equine Research Hall of Fame.",20120608,148,1-2,10.1016/j.vetimm.2012.05.015,1873-2534

Método: uma pesquisabibliográfica foi realizada utilizando-se as palavras-chave: sífilis congênita + imunopatogenia, sífilis materna+ imunopatogenia, sífilis + interface materno-fetal. As bases de dados pesquisadas foram a Medline (MedicalLiterature Analysis and Retrieval System Online) da National Library of Medicine (EUA) e a LILACS(Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde). Considerações finais: a infecção peloTreponema pallidum e o desenvolvimento das características clínicas deletérias deve-se ao êxito dosmecanismos de invasão, evasão e da resposta imunológica do hospedeiro. Na gestação ocorrem mudançashormonais, imunológicas e nutricionais necessárias ao bom desenvolvimento fetal que, porém, modulam asuscetibilidade materno-fetal à infecção. Nesse contexto, o perfil de citocinas na placenta tende a proteger ofeto de ser expulso, ao inibir a resposta celular citotóxica, dificultando, no entanto, a eliminação dotreponema da interface materno-fetal. Por outro lado, a resposta imunológica do feto ainda é imatura até a10ª - 20ª semana de gestação, permitindo que o patógeno invada, dissemine e escape. Assim, o diagnósticoprecoce para instituição do tratamento no recém-nascido é mandatório para prevenção das seqüelas e, comoainda não existe um exame laboratorial disponível na rede pública que permita esse diagnóstico em tempohábil, fica claro que um maior conhecimento da fisiopatogenia da doença é prioritário no sentido decontribuir para o avanço nas pesquisas clínicas",20121121,26,2,,0101-5907

Essa epidemia resultou em diversos casos de síndrome respiratória aguda grave e em um número significativo de mortes. O vírus influenza A/H1N1 acometeu de forma mais severa os integrantes de grupos de risco, como gestantes, crianças menores de dois anos, idosos acima de 60 anos, imunossuprimidos e portadores de comorbidades crônicas. As particularidades da gestação, como mudanças imunológicas, anatômicas e funcionais, expõem as mulheres grávidas a um maior risco de complicações respiratórias e cardíacas graves, que podem levar a óbito.Conclusões: Os estudos apontam que os possíveis fatores de morbidade e mortalidade entre gestantes acometidas pelo vírus influenza A/H1N1 foram síndrome de desconforto respiratório do adulto, embolia pulmonar, edema pulmonar, pneumonia bacteriana secundária e insuficiência renal. Além disso, as complicações durante a gravidez tendem a acontecer mais no segundo e terceiro trimestre. Medidas preventivas e um adequado tratamento provavelmente diminuirão o número de casos futuros de influenza pandêmica A/H1N1.",20120421,22,1,,1806-5562

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this cohort study, 48 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women without periodontitis were included. The pregnant women were evaluated in the first, second and third trimester and at 3 months postpartum, whilst the non-pregnant women were evaluated twice, with a 6-month interval. At each visit, clinical [plaque index (PlI) and gingival index (GI)], hormonal (salivary progesterone and estradiol), immunological [gingival crevicular fluid interleukin-1ß, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;) and prostaglandin-E(2) ] and microbiological (periodontal pathogens culture) evaluations were performed. Statistical analysis was undertaken using exhaustive chi-square automatic interaction detection (exhaustive CHAID) to analyse the predictive value of the independent outcomes to develop pregnancy GI. RESULTS: PlI was the strongest predictor implicated in the GI throughout pregnancy and after delivery. During the second and third trimesters the presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis significantly contributed to the worsening of gingival inflammation. When compared with the non-pregnant group, significant differences were found in TNF-&#945; amounts and concentrations and in the third trimester site-specific GI. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial challenge to the gingival tissues, both quantitatively (PlI) and qualitatively (harbouring P. gingivalis) appears to affect the level of gingival inflammation observed during pregnancy.",20111119,39,3,10.1111/j.1600-051X.2011.01800.x,1600-051X

The impact of exclusive breastfeeding in the presence of HIV infection on maternal and child health is still unclear. Socio-economic factors make breast-feeding an important source of nutrition for an infant 6 months and under in the developing world. A prospective study was conducted to examine the impact of feeding mode on various maternal indices including anthropometry; body composition indicators (using FTIR); haematology and biochemical markers; as well as incidence rates of opportunistic infections and clinical disease progression. In infants we examined the impact on growth, development and morbidity. AFASS criteria (affordable, feasible, accessible, sustainable and safe) were fulfilled by 38.7% of the formula feeding mothers. No significant differences between the formula feeding and breastfeeding groups in terms of haematological, immunological and body composition changes were seen. Breastfeeding mothers had significantly lower events with high depression scores (P = 0.043). Breastfeeding infants had a significantly lower risk of diarrhoea and hospitalisation at 3 months (P = 0.006 and 0.014 respectively). Breastfeeding was significantly associated with better development scores and growth parameters. Breastfeeding is not harmful to the mother in the presence of HIV infection. Mothers are still choosing formula feeding inappropriately despite counselling about the AFASS criteria. Breastfeeding is beneficial to the infants especially in the first 3 months of life.",20110421,16,3,10.1007/s10995-011-0795-8,1573-6628
