","J Autoimmun","MEDLINE","article","en","2022","","GB","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaut.2022.102864","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune inflammatory disease that predominantly affects women of childbearing age and results in various adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs). Pregnancy was formerly discouraged in patients with SLE because of unstable disease activity during the gestation period, increased thrombosis risk, severe organ damage, and inevitable side effects of immunosuppressive agents. Currently, most patients with SLE have successful pregnancies due to preconception counselling, strict monitoring, and improved therapy with minimised complications for both the mother and foetus. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is extensively used and is beneficial for improving pregnancy outcomes. However, pregnant women with SLE have a high-risk of APOs, such as disease flare, preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia, and pregnancy loss. Better understanding of the changes in maternal immunity and serum biomarkers, as well as their relationships with SLE-related APOs progression, would facilitate the investigation of molecular mechanisms for triggering and ameliorating APOs. Furthermore, it would enable us to explore and develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies to prevent disease activation. Therefore, this review briefly introduces the interaction between pregnancy outcomes and SLE, elucidates pathophysiological and immunological changes during SLE pregnancy. Furthermore, this review systematically expounds on the effective predictors of APOs and the molecular mechanisms underlying the SLE-related APOs to provide a solid foundation for the advanced management of lupus pregnancy.",20220725,,,10.1016/j.jaut.2022.102864,1095-9157

The best-studied alteration in autoimmunity is agalactosylation of immunoglobulin G (IgG), characterized primarily in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and then detected also in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and multiple sclerosis (MS). The rebuilding of IgG N-glycans in RA correlates with the relapses and remissions of the disease, is associated with physiological states such as pregnancy but also depends on applied anti-inflammatory therapy. In turn, a decreased core fucosylation of the whole pool of IgG N-glycans is a serum glycomarker in autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) encompassing Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and Grave's disease (GD). However, fucosylation of anti-thyroglobulin IgG (an immunological marker of HT) was elevated in HT serum. Core fucosylation of IgG oligosaccharides was also lowered in MS and SLE. In AITD and IBD, chronic inflammation T lymphocytes showed the reduced expression of MGAT5 gene encoding ß1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V) responsible for ß1,6-branching of N-glycans, which is important for T cell receptor activation. Structural changes of glycans have a profound effect on the pro-inflammatory activity of immune cells and serum immune proteins, including IgG in autoimmunity.",20210908,1325,,10.1007/978-3-030-70115-4_10,0065-2598

In the last few years, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were proven to be detrimental in both autoimmune diseases and placental injury. We investigated whether NETs could be detected in the placentas of pregnant individuals with SLE and explored the relationship between NETs and decidual natural killer cells (dNKs), which comprise the majority of immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface, using clinical samples and animal models. In this study, we found that the infiltration of NETs and dNKs, especially CD56+CD16+ NK cells, was significantly increased in pregnant individuals with SLE with placental insufficiency. In the murine models of SLE, the number of dNKs was significantly decreased due to the decreased formation of NETs affected by Ly6G. Moreover, the histopathological placental injury was reduced, with a remarkable increase in fetal birth weight. This study shows that NETs may contribute to immunological disorder in the placenta and the pathological changes in pregnancies with SLE, which provides a research basis for further explorations of the mechanism of SLE in placental impairment.",20210326,11,1,10.1038/s41598-021-86390-0,2045-2322

AIDs show different responses to pregnancy: some ameliorate, while others remain unchanged, and several AIDs aggravate. The response of the AIDs to the hormonal and immunological alterations of pregnancy reflects the different pathophysiology of each disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) are associated with multiple autoantibodies, multiorgan involvement, more aggressive therapy, and increased impact on pregnancy outcome. For the management of pregnancy in patients with SLE and/or APS, it is important to individuate the correct risk profile for each woman and timing for treatment. The optimal timing for starting or modulating treatment is at preconception assessment to influence the placentation.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a disease with well-represented immune mechanisms that disturb immune tolerance. The association of pregnancy with systemic lupus erythematosus creates a particular immune environment in which the immune tolerance specific of pregnancy is required to coexist with alterations of the immune system caused by SLE. The main role is played by T regulatory (Treg) cells, which attempt to regulate and adapt the immune system of the mother to the new conditions of pregnancy. Other components of the immune system also participate to maintain maternal-fetal immune tolerance. If the immune system of pregnant women with SLE is not able to maintain maternal immune tolerance to the fetus, pregnancy complications (miscarriage, fetal hypotrophy, and preterm birth) or maternal complications (preeclampsia or activation of SLE, especially in conditions of lupus nephritis) may occur. In certain situations this can be responsible for neonatal lupus. At the same time, it must be noted that during pregnancy, the immune system is able to achieve immune tolerance while maintaining the anti-infectious immune capacity of the mother. Immunological monitoring of pregnancy during SLE, as well as of the mother's disease, is required. It is important to understand immune tolerance to grafts in transplant pathology.",20150620,2015,,10.1155/2015/241547,2314-7156

In preconception, anti-DNA, hypocomplementemia, previous thrombosis, triple antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody positivity, active lupus nephritis and discontinuation of medications such as hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine are factors associated with pregnancy failure. During pregnancy, SLE flares are associated with aPL antibodies, synergic changes of pregnancy on Th1 and TH2 cytokines, other cytokines and chemokines that interact with hormones such as estrogen and prolactin that amplify the inflammatory effect. From the clinical point of view, SLE activity at pregnancy onset, thrombocytopenia, lupus nephritis, arterial hypertension, aPL syndromes, preeclampsia is associated with lupus flares and fetal complications. In puerperium, the risk factors of flares are similar to pregnancy. Hyperactivity of immune system, autoantibodies, hyperprolactinemia, active lupus nephritis, decrease in TH2 cytokines with increase in TH1 cytokines probably participate in SLE flare. The SLE flares during pregnancy make the difference between an uncomplicated pregnancy and pregnancy with maternal and fetal complications. Therefore, the knowledge of risk factors leads the best treatment strategies to reduce flares and fetal complications in SLE patients.",20141114,60,2-3,10.1007/s12026-014-8577-1,1559-0755

The use of IVIg in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is still considered experimental without any clear indications. The purpose of this systematic review is, therefore, to evaluate the available evidence to determine the therapeutic role of IVIg in SLE. A comprehensive, computerised search was performed in the MEDLINE (Pubmed), Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane controlled trials. The study eligibility criteria were randomized controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective observational studies that examined the efficacy of IVIg in adult patients with SLE who were considered the participants.IVIg therapy was the mode of intervention in these patients. Data abstracted included the study design, study population, changes in the disease activity scores (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index, Systemic Lupus Activity Measure, and Lupus Activity Index-Pregnancy), steroid dose, complement levels, autoantibodies, and renal function. Thereafter, data analysis established statistical procedures for meta-analysis. Thirteen studies (including 3 controlled and 10 observational) were eligible for inclusion. There was significant reduction in the SLE disease activity scores with IVIg therapy with a standard mean difference of 0.584 (P = 0.002, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.221-0.947). In terms of rise in complement levels, the response rate was 30.9% (P = 0.001, 95 CI 22.1-41.3). The effects of IVIg on other clinical outcome measures including anti-double-stranded DNA, antinuclear antibody, average steroid dose, and renal function could not be determined because of the limited numbers of trials. The limitations of this review were lack of well-designed controlled trials with adequate sample size on the use of IVIg in SLE. In conclusion, the use of IVIg is associated with significant reduction in SLE disease activity and improvement in complement levels.",20141014,93,16,10.1097/MD.0000000000000086,1536-5964

In this study, we hypothesized that pregnant women have reduced peripheral monocyte expression of chemokine receptors and alterations in PBMC responses to microbial stimuli as an adaption to pregnancy and that these changes are less pronounced in women with autoimmunity. We therefore investigated the chemokine receptor expression, migratory behaviour and responses to microbial stimulation of peripheral monocytes from pregnant women at parturition (n = 13) and from non-pregnant women (n = 9). In addition, we compared healthy pregnant women with women suffering from SLE (n = 5), a condition with pronounced systemic inflammation increasing the risk for pregnancy complications. We demonstrate that peripheral monocytes are affected by pregnancy with reduced percentages of CCR2+, CCR5+ and CXCR3+ monocytes of both classical (CD16-) and inflammatory (CD16+) subsets and that the trophoblast-secreted chemokine CCL2/MCP-1 recruited monocytes of both subsets in vitro. Further, PBMCs from pregnant women had a divergent response to microbial stimulation with lower CCL5/RANTES and higher CCL2/MCP-1 secretion compared with non-pregnant women. In addition, pregnant women had lower basal PBMC-secretion of CCL5/RANTES and higher basal secretion of IL-10 and CCL2/MCP-1. Interestingly, the women with SLE responded similar to pregnancy as did healthy women with lower percentages of CCR2+, CCR5+ and CXCR3+ monocytes. However, they had increased expression of CCR5 on CD16+ monocytes and heightened PBMC-secretion of CCL5/RANTES.
